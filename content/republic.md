# Plato's Republic

# Notes on [Great Minds Part 1]()

* theme of imbalance between power. Disjunction between power and knowledge
* Moral obligation to go down to the people and chat.
* Lots of symbolism in first book
* What you want or desire will be the characteristic of the soul and in turn the city

* Stating of the themes in the first scene, Framing scene
    * Moving down to paraues. Philospher kings move down to the people.
    * Attempt to move back up.
    * Basic theme, the dialectic between the powerful and the knowledgeable
        * This disjunction between power and knowledge that makes the enquiry necessary
    * Glaucon is making all the decisions. Group of men spontaneously turn into a democracy.
* Plato always chooses examples to represent something in the person he's talking to.
* Get rid of the old man, the past morality. Clear the slate. Young man who can still be changed.
* Being just is the truly social animal. Obligations for education, for the dispersion of knowledge, the ultimate
  virtue.
* Linguistic community (dialogue) sophist, like rhetoric, because there is no need to develop community, there end goal
  should be silence
* When a sophist doesn't like how the argument goes they become quiet or petulant.
* The knower only wants the get the better of the ignorant (for the benefit of others). Cardiologist example.
* Bait the young men into the (slightly weak argument with thrasymicus). Igniting their curiosity
