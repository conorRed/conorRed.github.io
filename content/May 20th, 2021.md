    - #productivity #growth 
    - Different types of workflow
    - Trello style for work, more procedural with odd persistent notes
    - Daily notes, generally daily thoughts or thoughts on what I read and listen too. So categorising these is very important.
    - Books, margin notes. No real system to integrate into digital notes. 
    - Should I rethink how I consume blog posts, whats the goal, I think having a page per paper, that may link into major thoughts could be better.
- Physics self study community
    - Online community in general #career 
    - physics tutor
- [[OPSENG-31449]]
    - staging doesn't have access to that endpoint, but it would work if it did.
