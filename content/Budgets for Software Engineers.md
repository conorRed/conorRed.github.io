#career 

There are 3 budgets a company can dip into for paying software engineers:
- Sales or Marketing.
- Research and Development.
- Maintenance. 

What motivates spending in each?

- If the company is growing, sales can be a major motivator in paying engineers. Input, in the form of work is directly linked to revenue. 
	- This is linked to directly seeing your ROI. But can create an environment of the next big hit.
- R and D build what the company sells. This budge wants _growth over time_.  This work is harder to measure but you're seen as an investment.
