Reinvent in 4 months

##  Discipline

Pick 3 key habits
- Personal (awe/quality etc.)
- Work
- Health.
Create core document (self.md )

## Values

- Reconnect with moral intuition, what defines a life well lived to you. Re-read maybe something
  that spoke to you.
- Write personal code. Approach to life through good and bad.

## Control

Gaining freedom from obligation and overwork to have space to do things.

- multiscale plan for work. So you have a quarterly goal or semester goal. You use this to guide
  your weekly plan which informs daily plan.

Escape the 'passion' mindset. Rather than thinking, 'what does this job offer me' think, 'What can I
offer this job', the 'craftsman' mindset. How would you like your life to be in 5, 10 years and work
back. You'll notice that the way your life will be may not be largely controlled by your job. Move
away from the validation through work. Maybe work on the other parts of your life, the
extra-curricular, the relationships etc.

[[Hannah Ritchie]] talk was good. I really liked the point that people are (somewhat) divided on the
climate change issue (expecially in America) from the survey data. However, pretty much no ones is
divided on clean energy. This kind of survey data captures my intuition about the energy transition.


How do I create meaning I can believe in?

- Work on problems that interest me?
