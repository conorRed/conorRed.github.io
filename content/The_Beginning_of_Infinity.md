      secrets through better and better explanations is exciting. There is a bottomless pit to the knowledge we can

* Hard to vary explanations and testability run in tandem as opposed to being independent. Each part of the explanation
  must be testable right? if we are to be able to error correct it.
* The truth will always be a chimera because we are fallible observer, we are not perfect. Think this was something Bret
