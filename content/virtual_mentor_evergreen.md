The idea that to solve an issue you're having you should 'write a correspondence' to your mentor. Go through your
problem and predict what your mentor will say, respond to that, try and 'not waste your mentors' time by answering what
you consider the obvious rebukes. Before you know it, you may not need your physical mentor at all, the idea of
'embodying' your mentors responses contributed towards a solution.
