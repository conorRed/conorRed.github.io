title: lemon water and feeling science

Andrea Collier talks about the 'fad' of lemon water in [this](https://youtu.be/rBQhdO2UxaQ) video. She makes the point that people are being lied too,
yes, but there are testimonies where people 'feel' it works. It's not really someones fault to have a belief they've
been lied about. They have some semblance of justification for it.

What's interesting to me is that I too have fallen for this, at least in one case, where I was trying to get leaner. I
stopped really eating carbs. Then, I attributed being lean to a lack of carbs which is not what makes sense
scientifically. You can still find correlations in your life for this belief but if there is a 'better' justification
for it, you should defer.
