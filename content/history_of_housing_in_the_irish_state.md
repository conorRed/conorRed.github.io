* [Understanding Irelands Housing challenge](https://publicpolicy.ie/perspectives/understanding-irelands-housing-challenge-in-the-light-of-housing-for-all/)
    * Interesting to note how Irelands policy just flipped to home ownership as the goal from the rental sector in the
      previous major policy 
    * The large amount of institutional investment in irelands residential investment goes into build to rent. We seem to
      need more investment from abroad as we can not fund it ourselves but this brings with it this supply of btr.
    * There's also a supply deficit. It seems that around 50,000 dwellings should be built a year for projected Irish
      population growth. The target for Housing for All is 30,000.
    * It is not clear if the decline in home ownership is due to supply shortage. Credit conditions could also play a role

    * To cope with a rise in demand for housing from economic growth in the early 90's the Urban renewal act allowed
      landlords to write off 100% of costs on their income tax, this was only 50% in the case of owner occupied landlords.
      This lead to 60% of subsidies units being owned by private landlords.
    * Despite these incentives ending in the mid 2000's cheap credit propped the development market up.
    * Home ownership for 25-34 year olds has declined from 68% in 1991 to 30% in 2016
    * There this changing landscape for demand, is policy then playing catch up?
* [Golden age of Irish social housing](https://www.ucd.ie/geary/static/publications/workingpapers/gearywp201901.pdf)
    * > Until recently almost all social housing in Ireland was delivered, owned and managed by local government, but
      apart from the United Kingdom, this model was rarely used elsewhere. In the rest of Western Europe social housing
      was provided by the independent, non-profit sector organisations (eg. cooperatives in Denmark, housing
      associations in the Netherlands and Austria), quasigovernmental municipal housing companies (in France and Sweden)
      or less commonly the private sector (Germany)
    * Coincided with the expansion of the welfare state
    * Services of housing loans became an issue
    * Funding of debt through rents.
    * Debt held by non profit agencies in other Western countries
    * Ireland financing was destabilised by politics
