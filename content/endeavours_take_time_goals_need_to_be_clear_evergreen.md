title: endeavours take time goals need to be clear
tags: evergreen training learning philosophy

Often times I think I'm subconsciously unreasonable about expectations of learnings or practice. I watched a video this
morning that followed Chinese weightlifter Liu Xaiojun. He saw weightlifting as a means to an end and found it grueling,
purely a way to get his family out of their small home town village. He eventually got some different training methods
and enjoyed it. I was watching a video about thermodynamics yesterday and how Sadi Carnot studied engines for three
years before his development of the Carnot cycle. 

I often feel when I put the bare minimum of thought or work in I should be seeing results but thats often an
unreasonable attitude. What I should be looking at is heuristics for progress. Something like this might be increasing
weights or reps in the gym. Continually facing challenging problems with Maths.

Any endeavour takes time and you wont always enjoy it. Whats important is that the goals are clear and that subgoals can
act as heurstics towards a larger goal. 

This is similar to that being a dwarf thinking.
