## Notes

* [Interesting video on historical theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvpJEc-NxVc&t=0s)
    * Post modernism, where truth is subjective falls down because belief can't be used to prove anything
    * Evidence is needed to prove or disprove.
    * Similar to rationalism of mapping the territory with tools for uncertainty
    * Publication (historical book) is an interpretation plus evidence
