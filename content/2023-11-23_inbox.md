* Q* could this be a breakthrough in reinforcment LLMs like Karpathy talks about [[ai]]

Creative problem solving seems to involve search. To have the paths in front of you and reason about them.

I think modelling the human trajectory or generally thinking about what variables play a factor in functions of growth
is important.

In relation to something like React development. It's evident that if the tooling for an AI can include interacting with
AWS or creating API's etc. then what I do in my day job could be automated. The cool thing is that with AI talking to
each other, or self-learning, they might create their own React or otherwise.

The cost of developing a website would go down incredibly.

Although a bottleneck here is the cost of energy (presuming an AI can't solve this). With energy super abundance and AI
the world will be crazy.

I really don't think I'll have a job in a year. Or at least what I work as will not exist in ten years. Customer can
just create their own solutions. They don't need the sack of chemicals (me) in the middle.
