title: personal values and leaps of faith

I've been listening a bit to Kierkegaard's ideas about the 'leap of faith'. The me it overlaps with Siver's notion about
beliefs as something that you can pick and choose. Ultimately, when you choose your values, or things you say you
believe in. Then, you take this leap of faith, you commit to them without further questioning. If the pursuit of
knowledge is what you're after then you may disagree with this statement but if beliefs are somewhat arbitrary maybe
Kierkegaard has a solution here for getting out of the rat run.
