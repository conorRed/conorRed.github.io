# The Greek Myths

I tried to kind of hash this out last night with no luck. 

Why is myth interesting? Lets just talk about the Greek Myths specifically

* Tells us how the ancient Mediterranean cultures thought about the world and their place in it, even in some cases not
  literally but symbolically. 
* The stories that are created are products of the world and culture. Kind of an interaction between what is the case
  and what people want to be the case.
    * Was it that the explanations of the world through gods was considered a good explanation or that it was pushed through
      oppressive structures?
* The belief structures and sheer variation of them are important too. Just in terms of trying to understand our
  ancestors. For instance, the different cults or attributions to different gods

### Classics

Why is the classical period so respected? For instance, the Renaissance was this rebirth where they looked back at
this 'Golden age'. Was it more as a re-aligning, to set a platform for progress? A homage and then move on. Or was it
that the best ideas were then and we should learn from them first and then have our own thoughts. 

It doesn't seem that there was no progress from those ancient ideas. At some level though a lot of ideas might have
their roots in the classical ideas because its like step 1,2,3 of the proof. Maybe this is the argument then of facing
the world. Build up your fundamentals of what came before and then progress with what you are in.

I always seem to find myself searching for a narrative in things I'm trying to understand. Or at least a coherence. This
leads to this which leads to this. Or just trying to simplify. It's a level of abstraction needed to condense
information.

Today, I found myself fascinated by the idea of the blank verse. A style of writing. The idea that you could morph words
in such a way in a given block to create emotion or imagination in the reader seemed fascinating. Escpecially something
like John Milton's paradise lost. I don't find myself immediately understanding or even recognising some cohesive
complexity (the complexity merely arising from my confusion) nor could I really tell poorly written complicated flowery
language from well written or respected complicated language (to a degree) but I was intrigued to delve into the verse.
To get familiar with its form.

I just want to note also that last night I was pretty much absorbed by Fry's retelling of the myth of Psyche and Eros. It
interesting to note that Eros did not want to be seen. She fell in love with something more than his looks it seems. What
that was, I'm not too sure.
