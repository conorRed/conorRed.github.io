# Computational Power and AI

Computation refers to a _stack_ :

- Chips, such as GPU's.
* Software to increase usage of these chips.
* Domain Specific languages.
* Data management software.

FLOPS/s is the rate measure for the amount of floating point operations a resource can carry out in a second.

>  the amount of compute used by AI models doubled in about 21.3 months; since
>  deep learning as a paradigm took hold around 2010, the amount of compute
>  used by models started doubling in only 5.7 months

They reference Sara Hooker, saying that she theorises that research ideas win
when they are associated with current hardware and software computer
capabilities.

So it's a dynamic where the software in deep learning was slowly making
progress and once the incentive is created to use hardware it just takes off.
