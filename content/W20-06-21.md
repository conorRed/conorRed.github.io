# What went well

* Managed to get through a large portion of the Republic
* Did a small amount of Physics problems (didn't just abandon it completely)
* Talked to my manager about issues at work and kind of came out of it with solutions
* Started website and looking at vimwiki along with this getting more comfortable with laptop

## What could have went better

* My focus was fairly poor on occasion mainly down to habits so not necessarily something completely out of my control
    * I think particularly this happens when I question the use of my time or throw uncertainty on to it
   
## Goals for this week

* Put some thought into the idea of Ireland's political thought and current geo political situation and whether it could
  become a hub of innovation. I think spending an hour a day on this is a good target.
* Try and find two hours during the week for Physics, particularly continuing with the Feynman lectures. Spend two two
  hour sessions at the weekend.
* I would say turn phone off every evening but with on call I can't do this.
* Start reading MacBeth (can fit in 1hr reading before bed)
* Start reading Europe again (can fit in 1hr reading before bed)
* Review Republic (try and do this with 3hrs over the week)
* Read history 2hrs a night! New goal after listening to the Tom Holland podcast on Hitler.
