- #DailyThoughts Reading a History of Western Philosophy I think I got more familiar with the idea of tackling hard problems, essentially, of basic philosophy. I think this is an important thinking. Taking what you conceive as intractable and tackling them as opposed to just accepting their intractability. It's somewhat similar to use cases or possible places code can go wrong. You might find that as you have a dialectic with the problem you discover either It's tractability or can confirm the opposite.

    - Deconstruct the skill. What are the parts of the skill to get me where I want
    - Get resources about what I want to learn. Use them to self-correct. Noticing when you're making a mistake. This could be where reference comes in.
    - Remove practice barriers. Distractions.
    - Practice at least 20 hours.

    - "What we think of is the fact that the whole spectrum of reproductive problems in males are increasing by about 1 percent per year in Western countries. This “1 percent effect” includes the rates of [declining sperm counts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6455044/), [decreasing testosterone levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19396984/) and increasing rates of [testicular cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4698396/), as well as a rise in the prevalence of [erectile dysfunction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29506875/). On the female side of the equation, [miscarriage rates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29053188/) are also increasing by about 1 percent per year in the U.S., and so is the rate of gestational surrogacy. Meanwhile, the [total fertility rate worldwide](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN) has dropped by nearly 1 percent per year from 1960 to 2018."
    - "The truth is, these reproductive health effects are interconnected, __and__ they are largely driven by a common cause: the presence of hormone-altering chemicals (a.k.a., [endocrine-disrupting chemicals](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm), or EDCs) in our world. These hormone-hijacking chemicals, which include phthalates, bisphenol A, and flame retardants, among others, have become ubiquitous in modern life. They’re in water bottles and food packaging, electronic devices, personal-care products, cleaning supplies and many other items we use regularly. And they began being produced in increasing numbers after 1950, when sperm counts and fertility began their decline."
