- Look at title being posted in slack. Uses one artifact
- Our ethical systems relate and will never escape ... human nature. Chomsky
    - Talking about the drowning child dilemma
    - Chomsky thinks that we'd be better off looking at the actual issues as they are and making the ethical decisions there. Not philosophising. Not really about in principle whether we should be concerned about a child drowning etc. His view is that we wont find an answer to this. What we can do is find answers to the real world problems
    - Concerned with some ethical system we dont have.
