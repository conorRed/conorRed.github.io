## Daily checklist

* [X] Join CATU
* [X] Set up to donate to GiveWell

## Notes

* Lex Friedman podcast with Jed Buchwald. Interesting point about some mathematical concept can open up experimentation
  and tool making, uses the example of the wave theory of light and development by French mathematician allowed
  experiments to be evaluated.
* "LessWrong posts, or something similar, but you’re not really confident enough that they’re right to put them out
  there. My advice is: don’t try to persuade people that the idea is true/good. Persuasion is a bad habit from high
  school. Instead, try to accurately describe where the idea came from, the path which led you to think it’s
  true/plausible/worth a look". Maybe I should start on less wrong and cross post on my website.
* [Short intro to effective altruism Macaskill](http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/MacAskill-Effective-Altruism-short-intro.pdf)
    * He demonstrates the Scale, Neglectedness and solvability measures here. I wonder could I apply them to the energy
      crisis. Can we frame the problem with numbers?
    * I need to get my shit together donating my salary. I need to see how much I can afford to donate.
    * Tax breaks for donating?
    * Workday matching contribution? 850e cap, so would have to do it manually
