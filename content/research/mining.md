The biggest mine is a copper one that's about a land area of 7km.

* Iron is incredibly abundant. About 1 billion tonnes of it is processed per year.
* The most common ore's of iron were hematite, goethite and limonite. Mainly occurring in rock deposits.
* The workers in the early mines knew 'how' but not the 'why' of iron production. Up until the 18th century in some
  places it was thought that if iron was just left alone it would replenish.
* Before the use of explosives to separate the ore from the rock fire setting was used 
  > Fire-setting involves constructing a fuel-pile (typically wood) up against the exposed rock and then letting it burn
  (typically overnight); the heat splinters, cracks and softens the rock. The problem of course is that the fire is
  going to consume all of the oxygen and let out a ton of smoke, preventing work close to an active fire 
* As far as recalled, most pre modern mining was open pit. 
* > So to recap, our iron tool begins its life as a vein or bed of iron-rich ore. Our miners, detecting this ore
  probably by where it outcrops to the surface, have most likely constructed an open-pit mine to extract it. Bit by bit,
  using shovels for the soil and then picks, hammers and chisels for the rock underneath, the non-metal-bearing rock is
  cleared away to expose to the ore itself. The ore is then cleared in much the same manner. Where it is stubborn, the
  miners set fires over the rock or against the sides of their pits to shatter the stone for easier removal. Apart from
  this fire-setting, all of the energy to hew our bit of hematite or limonite or what have you out of the ground is
  provided by human muscle. Once extracted, the ore is loaded into baskets (probably wicker-work, but the exact basket
  depends on where we are) and manually hauled out of the pit to the surface.
* It seems mines were mainly owned by nobility or the 'state'. 
* Generally, if you were unskilled there was no where else to go really
* > This inefficiency, an economy not well organized to effectively employ surplus labor, is a common feature of
  pre-modern economies, creating a ready supply of people desperate enough to do things like work in the mines merely to
  eat

* The assumption that coal was used to make iron from the get go means that coking, the process of getting the pure
  carbon out of coal had to be solved for. 
* > .The problem with coal is that it has to go through a process of coking in order to create a pure mass of carbon
  (called ‘coke’) which is suitable for use. Without that conversion, the coal itself both does not burn hot enough, but
  also is apt to contain lots of sulfur, which will ruin the metal being made with it, as the iron will absorb the
  sulfur and produce an inferior alloy (sulfur makes the metal brittle, causing it to break rather than bend, and makes
  it harder to weld too). Indeed, the reason we know that the Romans in Britain experimented with using local coal this
  way is that analysis of iron produced at Wilderspool, Cheshire during the Roman period revealed the presence of sulfur
  in the metal which was likely from the coal on the site.
* However, it's possible that China could have learned about coking as early as the 11th century!
* In latin, wood for building was _materia_ whereas wood for burning was _lignum_.
