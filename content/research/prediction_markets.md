# Prediction Markets

_Prediction markets are forums for trading contracts that yield payments based on the outcome of uncertain events._[^1]

* Think of it as buying or selling shares in an event occurring.[^2]
* Pays out 1 unit of currency if the event occurs, and nothing if it doesn't.
* The idea is that the market belief (price) represents a likelihood of the event.

* A futures market is a prediction market
* Prediction markets incentivise those with knowledge to trade. It's not just the mass opinion?
* You can't make money unless you add information. Interesting notion.



# Betting and belief

* Shares in outcomes
    * If you see a listing for shares of an outcome at 60c.
    * Only shares for the outcome that occurred can be redeemed for money.
    * If I'm 100% confident the thing will happen. Then I'll buy 1000 of those listing or as much as I could possibly buy.

* If you use a model where speculators push supply into the future, or transport it through time rather than space.
* "Taking resources from where they have lower value, through time to where they have higher value".

* interestingly Yudkowsky talked about the notion that we really don't know more than an expert or the 'Efficient market
  Hypothesis' in determining what AI would do. He uses the example of what the next chess move should be. You could
  guess but if Kasparov is also guessing he's going to be better at it than you. Similarly for markets in the world, if
  you were better than at least some portion of the markets in the world you would make loads of money but literally no
  one is better or has more information than these markets (otherwise they would make lots of money consistently).


* A bet is just a 'realisation' of a belief. It doesn't feel like it but when you see a x dollars gain to be made from a
  stock, that is, you think it's got a gap x between it's real and actual price. The more you feel (believe) you can
  gain, The more of the stock you're willing to buy.
* Bet's seem fundamental to beliefs.

* Reading http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/gamble.html
    * Hanson sees storytelling as the major problem in science as opposed to actually trying to discover whats right.
    * There are insider's who largely decide what is and isn't relevant.
    * Outsiders find it hard to get published. The outsiders from before the Scientific Revolution kind of birthed the
      insiders of the Scientific Revolution.
    * "Image what would happen if we used academic peer review to decide what products to manufacture" is an interesting
      way of looking at the way we determine what is and isn't worth pursuing in Science (peer review).
    * In his proposal for a new institution Hanson looks at what we actually want out of our academic institutions:
        * > Presumably we want as much progress as possible per effort invested, at least in situations where the following
          notion of "progress" makes sense. Consider a well-posed question, such as "Is the Earth basically spherical?",
          with a handful of possible answers (such as "No, its flat"). Experience indicates that, with enough study and
          evidence, one of the answers will eventually stand out as best to most anyone who considers the question
          carefully. At least this seems to happen for most questions that have been traditionally labeled "scientific";
          questions about the morality of abortion or the nature of God may not fare as well. Where there is such a limiting
          "right" answer, "progress" can mean the rate at which general scientific opinion converges to that answer. This
          definition of progress hopefully avoids debates about whether more knowledge is good, or whether there is really
          an ultimate truth.
        * > Bets are a long- established and robust reputation mechanism, widely seen as a cure for excessive verbal
          wrangling; you "put your money where your mouth is". In science and elsewhere, phrases like "you bet" are
          standard ways to express confidence. Offers to make token bets are particularly compelling, and scientists of
          equal stature often make and publicize such bets, with recent bets on resource depletion, computer chess,
          black holes
    * My understanding is that Hanson proposes an "idea futures" market where reputations are staked on pools of
      questions. The consensus on questions is considered academic consensus. Hanson seems to put an emphasis on stakes
      or claims being made so that there is some form of 'investment' of one's reputation in bets.
