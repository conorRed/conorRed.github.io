1.

a.

$E[X] = \sum_xxp_X(x)$

2.

A marksman takes 10 shots at a target and has probability 0.2 of hitting the target with each
shot, independently of all other shots. Let X be the number of hits

a. pmf is p(x) = 0.2^{x}
b. (0.8)^10
c. P(X>5) = summation (on pmf) of greater than 5 hits.
e. Pays 3 dollars to enter. Gets 2 dollar for each shot. You would take the difference between 3 and the expected value
from d (which I didn't do). This would give you Y, whose expected value is Y. The variance is 0? No not zero.
f. This is the standard deviation.


4. 

4 buses, 148 students, 4 bus drivers, 40, 33, 25, 50 students on each of the 4 buses.
X: no. of students on the bus carrying randomly selected student. 
Y: no. of students on the bus carrying randomly selected drive. 

a.

I would assume X is larger although it's only on a scale of 1-4 so probably not by much.
b.

what is the pmf of each random variable?

There are 4 possible values x that X can take on.

You would expect that if you kept selecting students, you would have a proportional relationship between the number on
each bus and the value x.

There's 40/148 for bus 1 (addition of probabilities for outcome x = 1)
There's 33/148 for bus 2
There's 25/148 for bus 3
There's 50/148 for bus 4

E[X] = 1*40/148 + 2*33/148 + 3*25/148 + 4*50/148 = 2.57.

The pmf for Y is 1/4 for each y.

E[Y] = 1*0.25 + 2*0.25 + 3*0.25 + 4*0.25 = 2.5.

# Problem Set 3

1.

The hats of n persons are thrown into a box. The persons then pick up their hats at random.
What is the probability that 

a. Every person gets his or her hat back


We have k trials but each trial is not independent. The probability of finding your hat is a function of hats in the
box, which reduces over the number of trials. 

The probability for the first person is 1/n
For the second it's 1/n-1
For the third 1/n-2 and so on.

1/n*1/n-1... = 1/n!.

b.

What does the sample space look like for this?
Is it a big tree like thing?

Anyways,
So for the first m people we've a probability 1/n*1/n-1*1/n-2 ... n-m
After m people we don't care. So its (n-m)!/n!

c. everyone among the first m persons to pick up the hats gets back a hat belonging to one of
the last m persons to pick up the hats? 

How many ways can this happen?
Out of n choose n-m ways that the first m could pick up someone elses hat outside of the first m people.

Choose one of these way's so 1/ n choose n-m

d. Now assume, in addition, that every hat thrown into the box has probability p of getting dirty
(independently of what happens to the other hats or who has dropped or picked it up). What is
the probability that the first m persons will pick up clean hats.

(1 - p)^m

e. Exactly m people will pick up clean hats.

**I dont understand the solution to this one**

## 2.

Alice randomly chooses 4 cards out of a 52-card
Then Bob randomly chooses 8 cards out of the same deck. (cards replaced)

Alice wins if Bobâ€™s cards include all cards selected by her. What is the
probability of this happening? 

For each selection by Bob, he's 1/52 chance of picking one of Alice's cards.

If we focus purely on Bob's selection. There are 4 cards in the 52 card outcome space that are considered a 'success'.

Bob has 52 choose 8 ways of choosing his 8 cards.

If we take the subset of this space where he has chosen all 4 of Alice's cards. It doesn't matter what order he picks
them up in, so there's one way he can pick her 4 cards. Then 48 choose 4 to pick up the rest. 

It seems like this is a reasonable probability but it's basically zero percent.

## 4.

Two fair three-sided dice are rolled simultaneously. Let X be the difference of the two rolls.

a.

There are 9 total outcomes. 

(1, 1) x = 0, (1, 2) x = 1, (1, 3) x = 2
(2, 1) x = 1, (2, 2) x = 0, (2, 3) x = 1
(3, 1) x = 2, (3, 2) x = 1, (3, 3) x = 0

X is a function mapping each pair to the number line by |x - y|.

p_X(0) = 3 * 1/9 = 1/3
p_X(1) = 4 * 1/9 = 4/9 
p_X(2) = 2 * 1/9 = 2/9

E[X] = 4/9 + 4/9 = 0.8 Var(X) = E[X - E[X^2]]

Var(X) = (0 - 0.8)1/3 + (1 - 0.8)4/9 + (2 - 0.8)2/9 =

2.

X is the number of papers for a grade to come up for the first time.
X is a geometric random variable.

$p_X(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1}p$

Expected value is apparently 1/p

p = 1/6. Expected value 6 for each grade so you'd expect 36 papers for all grades


3.

The $\sum_yp_Y = 1$ and $\sum_yp_X|Y = 1 = \sum_x\frac{X=x \cap Y=y}{P(Y=y)}$



for y = 3 $\sum_x\frac{4c}{}$
for y = 2 $\sum_yp_X = 6c$
for y = 1 $\sum_yp_X = 10c$
c = 1/20 because one of these value's must be the case.

b.

6/20.

I got lazy here and looked at the solutions. Hopefully, if I take a quiz I can see where my weak points are.
Conditioning of Random variables is confusing.
