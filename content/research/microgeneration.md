# Microgeneration

The notion of a shared resource for energy should not be taken for granted. The initial rise of power production for
electricity in the US took the form of privately owned generators and infrastructure. At the time, this was due to the
different end use load requirements and the inability of a generator to transmitted that power over a very long
distance. What we have now is a power system that is quite the opposite. Large transmission structures transmit power
across hundreds of kilometers maintaining high efficiencies and catering to variable loads (end users with different
requirements). Could this cycle back towards more private generation? Is that something that people would want? Is it
the most efficient way to do things? If we look at something like heating, its taken as a given in most places that you
have some unit in your home, there is no central distribution of heat like that of electricity. As technologies improve
in areas like district heating this centralization is becoming more of a viable alternative. 

## Scales
_the hope here is to get a sense of a simple calculation that can be used to filter all the following detail through_

Before looking at how the grid might manage a large amount of variable generation on their system its important to get a
notion of scale. How many kWh do you need to power your home every day? More than likely, you've no clue. For renewables
a comparison of energy utilised should be done over timescales longer than a day, this is because they're variable [^1].
Median residential metered electricity consumption was 3,594 kWh in 2021 [^2]. This is the energy usage I'm trying to
cover. Solar is the most accessible form of providing my own energy. 

* Usage: What is your usage.
    * If you're heating system is based on electricity, this also goes up.
    * It's also very personal and variable. If your usage is mainly due to heating for instance, then maybe look at
      insulation etc. first. 
    * Roughly 60% of home energy usage is for spatial heating, another 20% for water heating.
    * When do you need electricity? If you don't have storage and your not home all day, what's the point?
    * Looking at battery as well, do you really want to send energy back to the grid if they'll just resell it to you
      for more money?

Good overview video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUrGvwphJ3I The above is supposedly very accurate as and
estimation.

# Notes

This notion of usage kind of hits a larger point of efficiency and using energy in the home, being conscious of it,
interacting with it in some sense. When its gamified in some sense it might become more interesting. It's this
subconscious thing to overcome, like what Bakke talks about.
