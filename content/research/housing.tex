\emph{Following Karnofsky method}

Step 1: pick a topic. First, I decide what I want to form an opinion
about. My basic approach here is: ``Find claims that are important if
true, and might be true.''

Step 2: read and/or discuss (a bit). I usually start by trying to read
the most prominent 1-3 pieces that (a) defend the claim or (b) attack
the claim or (c) set out to comprehensively review the evidence on both
sides

Step 3: explain and defend my current, incredibly premature hypothesis,
in writing (or conversation).

Step 4: find and list weaknesses in case.

I think what might be useful is to construct some `stakeholder'
profiles/takes on the current situation that I think are out there. Then
try and get evidence to back each one.

\emph{Try and focus on statements that have an effect on outcome}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Housing supply in Ireland is low due to construction costs and land
  regulation. Land tax should be instituted along with more data on
  construction value chain to reduce its costs.
\item
  Institutional investors are a small portion of the housing market
  (buying and selling of housing) and of the rental market (letting).
\item
  The way out is to incentivise more private funding to meet demand in
  all it's diversity. That is, the government would be too slow an
  organization to meet the changing demand and would make things worse.
\item
  The government can not afford to meet housing need. Supply is
  currently way below demand.

    Interesting to note how Irelands policy just flipped to home
    ownership as the goal from the rental sector in the previous major
    policy
  \item
    The large amount of institutional investment in irelands residential
    investment goes into build to rent. We seem to need more investment
    from abroad as we can not fund it ourselves but this brings with it
    this supply of btr.
  \item
    There's also a supply deficit. It seems that around 50,000 dwellings
    should be built a year for projected Irish population growth. The
    target for Housing for All is 30,000.
  \item
    It is not clear if the decline in home ownership is due to supply
    shortage. Credit conditions could also play a role

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To cope with a rise in demand for housing from economic growth in
    the early 90's the Urban renewal act allowed landlords to write off
    100\% of costs on their income tax, this was only 50\% in the case
    of owner occupied landlords. This lead to 60\% of subsidies units
    being owned by private landlords.
  \item
    Despite these incentives ending in the mid 2000's cheap credit
    propped the development market up.
  \item
    Home ownership for 25-34 year olds has declined from 68\% in 1991 to
    30\% in 2016

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    At the end of 2.1 there is a discussion of the `path dependence' of
    irish housing based on financing model. Analyses in Blackwell and
    Kohl (2008)
  \item
    Ireland is converging demographically to the EU average in terms of
    population growth and the no. of apartments
  \item
    Two thirds of landlords in a survey commissioned by the RTB own just
    one property.
  \item
    \begin{quote}
    For almost all of the 19th century, there were no purpose-built
    apartments constructed in Ireland. This and the later absence of
    apartment construction reflects a unique element of Ireland's
    demographic development: unlike all our European peers, Ireland's
    population fell, rather than increased rapidly, between the mid-19th
    and mid20th century. This meant there was, effectively, no pressure
    on either the policy or finance systems to plan how to accommodate
    density: instead, sparser and more sprawled greenfield development
    was sufficient
    \end{quote}
  \item
    There was virtually no private rental accomadation built at the
    start of the 20th century in Ireland due to viability (which I think
    means that the market price wasn't even enough to cover costs). Most
    building was subsidised and suburban due to transport infrastruce
    slowly being set up.
  \item
    An example is given of the disparity between the market price and
    costs of development even in the 60's. It is similar to today, where
    incomes just can't match the break even price.
  \item
    Ireland followed the European trend post war to build pre caste
    large scale developments (liek Ballymun) later following what other
    countries do mixing tenures (in terms of market renters and social
    renters together)
  \item
    In the 80's the government tried to deal with the lack of viability
    for capital with a 40\% subsidy for cost of developments
  \item
    Under section 23 you could get the cost of building minus the site
    cost off the income you made from rent. So anything you built would
    contribute towards you not having to pay tax on the rent you earned
    from it. This was also aggregate rental income. You could be
    building houses that there were no demand for but getting a huge tax
    break on the income you were making from somewhere else.
  \item
    This seems to have worked as rents decreased after it's
    implementation
  \item
    This tax break only applied to private taxpayers which meant that
    institutional investors were essentially priced out?
  \item
    2.3
  \item
    2.4

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Institutional investors play an important role in build to rent
      projects as they have access to longer term capital from European
      markets. Like pension funds. This means they can spread the costs
      of construction over a longer period of time.
    \item
      This is frowned upon in Ireland as it's seen as `squeezing out'
      the regular developer(?). How else would this accomadation be
      built?

  \item
    Show's scatterplots that link increases in supply with reduction in
    rent and vice versa. The equilibrium seems to be above 4,000 units

  \item
    Interesting how this is the largest rental boom in modern history,
    I'm not too sure what the cause of the others were.

    3.2

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Almost 80\% of developments use foreign captial. Either in equity
      or debt form.
    \item
      My mental model here for equity is some firm that is `investing'
      in a development rather than just expecting their money back.
    \item
      Interesting that during the tiger the `pillar banks' played a
      large role in capital circulation. That now they are more
      restrained so it was inevitable that some other form of capital
      must come in. Also, they were intermdeiaries for foreign capital.
      So the money you were getting from the bank was just coming from
      overseas anyways \includegraphics{img/chart.png}

    This report seems to talk more about economic cylces and how they

  \item
    \begin{quote}
    Rising rents can also increase the cost faced by the exchequer in
    providing housing. With regard to housing measures funded through
    current expenditure, a large share of the rental sector in Ireland
    is in receipt of some form of support. Data from the 2016 census
    indicates that 326,8324 households rent from a landlord (including
    voluntary and co-operative bodies). As of 2021Q2, there were
    approximately 62,000 active HAP tenancies, 17,500 RAS tenancies, and
    5,000 privately leased SHCEP operational units (DHLGH). This
    indicates that approximately 26\% of households residing in the
    rental sector are in receipt of some form of housing support that is
    funded through current expenditure.
    \end{quote}
  \item
    Be interesting to check this for the most recent census.
  \item
    Interesting point on how more strict mortgage lending rules affect
    price signals and push people to the rental sector, so rent increase
    more than avg. house prices.
