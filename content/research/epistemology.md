# Epistemology

> Before me is a grassy green field. A line of trees marks its far edge, which
is punctuated by a spruce on its left side and a maple on its right. Birds are
singing. A warm breeze brings the smell of roses from a nearby trellis. I reach
for a glass of iced tea, still cold to the touch and flavored by fresh mint. I am
alert, the air is clear, the scene is quiet. My perceptions are quite distinct.

> It seems altogether natural to believe these things given my experience,
and I think I justifiably believed them. I believed them, not in the way I would
if I accepted the result of wishful thinking or of merely guessing, but with
justification.

* beliefs from perception like this justified, not through some process of justification but inherent in the fact that
  they're just considered that way.

> Being justified in believing something is having justification for believing it. This, in turn, is roughly a matter of
having ground for believing it...**Our justification for believing is basic raw material for actual justified belief;
and justified belief is commonly good raw material for knowledge.**

> Belief justification occurs when there is a certain kind of connection between what yields situational justification
and the justified belief that benefits from it. Belief justification occurs when a belief is grounded in, and thus in a
way supported by (or based on), something that gives one situational justification for that belief, such as seeing a
field of green. Seeing is of course perceiving; and perceiving is a basic source of knowledgeâ€”perhaps our most elemental
source, at least in childhood. This is largely why perception is so large a topic in epistemology

## Induction

An appeal to the 'uniformity of nature' is required to extend knowledge beyond our personal experience.
