<p><em>Notes on Art of Living and general books around Stoicism</em></p>
<p>What’s attractive to me about Stoicism is the application of
philosophy to life. First of all, the notion that we have a soul, that
we want to be pure, or that we pursue virtue and try and justify why is
worth questioning. Is it social conditioning that this is the case? If
so, it’s some general social conditioning over vast timescales which is
essentially the same thing as ‘inherently human’ or even an ‘objective
truth’.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophical principles aren’t there to be merely learned, your
soul should be shaped by them.</li>
<li>This is done through <em>digestion</em> and
<em>habituation</em>.</li>
<li>A period of learning what the core tenets are followed by repeated
<em>spiritual exercises</em> to incorporate them into your being.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>What is <em>good</em> for the Stoics is whatever the rational soul
desires. As to what this is, how variable it is, I’m not too sure.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="physics">Physics</h1>
<ul>
<li>The cosmos, for the Stoics is the large organism of a kind. From
it’s generation (generative principle) it’s causes are
predetermined.</li>
<li>This notion is present in Meditations as Marcus tries to integrate
himself with this cosmos,</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Freeing oneself of this limited first person perspective will free
one from the emotional turmoil that comes with it.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>In the same way, when something is seen as food ‘for me’ or ‘bad for
me’ elevating oneself to this position allows it’s evaluation outside of
this first person perspective.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man,
otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper
subject matter. For just as wood is the material of the carpenter,
bronze that of the statuary, so each individual’s own life is the
material of the art of living.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epictetus</li>
</ul>
<p>Seller’s describes the aim of his book ‘The Art of Living’ es
exploring “the possibility of a conception of philosophy in which
philosophical ideas are primarily expressed in behaviour, a conception
in which understanding is developed not for its own sake but rather in
order to transform one’s way of life, a conception of philosophy that
would make biography not merely incidentally relevant but rather of
central importance to philosophy”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Socrates forms this basis or template for philosophy could have been
viewed to those after his time. That it’s aform of mastery over one’s
soul. What interesting is how resonant this becomes. There is a faculty
of our nature that agrees with virtue. Maybe, from a social perspective
it’s important to have temperance.</li>
<li>Highlighted in this book is the notion of the different kinds of
arts. Particularly the art of medicine where you’re goal isn’t to always
succeed but be in pursuit of accomplishment. I think this is something
the Stoics or at least popular culture Stoicism would agree with.</li>
