If I'm being totally honest, I'm not getting enough feedback on the code I'm doing. This might be unavoidable but is
worth noting.

* Need to get more familiar with standard error.
* Review notes see if I can create some new ones.
* Rolling brief, explain mass flow using screenshots from excel of fuel.

Complexity at the heart of software and Vernons thoughts. Expanding on my thinking with replication of model.

Expectations = claims about future events.

I'm not looking at knowledge creation, more just knowledge externalization.
I think if I perceive the externalization of tacit knowledge as the goal where tacit knowledge is related to assumptions
and credences of results.

Can I replicate the sensitivity analysis with mass balance branch?

Systematic error is shifting by a constant.

The likelihood is low that I would be able to do anything useful but could I take a look at agent based programming or
Bayesian based programming to incorporate assumptions into a model. Like how I've been thinking about the tacit
knowledge involved in this project.
