I think sometime I should try and focus on is getting into a position where I can get better feedback on what I'm
learning. It seems also that statistics and probability are tools, what questions to I want to look at?

It seems that sampling is useful when integration over the probability space becomes infeasible.

### Bayesian Statistics Notation

* $\Theta$ is the random variable of interest. $X = (X_1, ... X_n)$ is an **observation vector**.
* We must assume we know the joint probability of any x and $\Theta$.
