Planning to look through uncertainty standard this morning a do a walk through with one of the input variables to a
process.

An example of a design change would be, do we want to be able vary the percentage of triglycerides? 
Do we want the mass inputs more fine grained?
Along with this comes the previous question

> Why do we only care about tri-olein, linolein and palmitin? What about the di's?

Also, could we work back to a distribution from a sensitivity analysis?

Unsure as to how sensitivity operates in the standard uncertainty, need to do further reading.

Next steps would most likely be to write some tests.
