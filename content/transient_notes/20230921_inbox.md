I've been struggling a small bit seeing the path forward in what I want to learn. PGM's have been hard. I guess I'm just
trying not to give up. I think what I'm really looking for is something I care about to model or code. A problem to
solve.

Should I just try and work through statistical rethinking? I lacks the evidence that I've done it (certificate). I think
I need to take a practical lens. I need to learn about modelling dynamical systems (calculus etc.) there may not be some
pedagogy for this. In the hopes of modelling what though? I think this is covered by classical mechanics study.

What a _my_ questions about the world?
