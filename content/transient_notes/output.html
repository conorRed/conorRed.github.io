      <p>A test note just to see if this is working</p>
<p>The difference between pmf’s and pdf’s is the difference between mass
and density.</p>
<p>I think the <em>propagation of error</em> is whats going on with the
partial derivate time the expected variation in the standards doc.</p>
<p>Meeting with Stephen this morning, will see what his ideas are which
will affect what I do this week. Also, chat with Liam this week which
will, once again, affect things.</p>
<p>The general model is the <em>fishbone diagram</em>. For this week
I’ll work on perturbation analysis, so moving variables by 1 standard
deviation from the expected value and seeing effect on outcomes.</p>
<p>Because each input has its own specific domain range (if its an rv)
then its a further case that inputs should be considered random
variables. Or just have a special type of input?</p>
<p>Am I pestering Mark too much?</p>
<p><strong>What I have at the moment is moving within a ten percent
range each input. A further refinement would be to take a more
‘educated’ guess on this range through assumptions etc. Given this, is
it a worthwhile output?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What could be considered a ‘finished’ perturbation analysis
(should I look to research)?</strong></p>
<p>Lindley defines the balls in the urn as a <em>standard</em> like a
unit of length, trying to intuit how far to extend this analogy based on
what I think probability (a mathematical model) is so far.</p>
<p>This morning I’m going to try and build up my knowledge of the fuel
production process. The goal being to ELI5 the whole process.</p>
<p>The aim is to get some range of hydrocarbons of particular chain
lengths from an initial substance that has hydrocarbons but not in the
desired composition.</p>
<p>Hydrotreating: aims to remove impurities like sulphur and
nitrogen.</p>
<p>Distillation is a <em>separation</em> technique. It takes advantage
of the differing boiling points of molecules in a substance. The lighter
the substance, the lower its boiling point (temperature at which it
changes from liquid to gas). Heating a composite liquid will create
vapour that will condense at lower temperatures the lighter the
molecules.</p>
<p>In simple distillation you’ve a substance with sufficiently different
boiling points. Heating the mixture to above the boiling point of one,
turning it to vapor which should leave a large portion of the other
liquid behind. The vapor can then be cooled as it passes through a
chamber, condensing it.</p>
<p>Its interesting that in the case of fractional distillation its a
simple process but the aim is to do it at a really large scale.</p>
<p>Crude oil is a huge composition of hydrocarbons all with different
boiling points. The output fuel is some extraction of hydrocarbons of a
given range from this oil.</p>
<p>Fractional distillation is kind of like a ladder of heating to
boiling points and ‘drawing’ off hydrocarbons This video details the
bottle cap technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xzYf8IL_FE.</p>
<p>The ‘point’ of the filtration and hydro treatment steps is to be left
with just a composition of hydrocarbons. Oxygen is removed in this
second step. The by products are CO/CO2/H2O.</p>
<p>I think I need a way to represent the oil throughout the processes,
this is the mass that never changes just gets rearranged, it would be
handy if all processes had access to it. <strong>For any process we want
to know its energy and the composition of the production (where all the
masses are, because its a mass balance), the mass flow.</strong></p>
<p>I’m finding it hard to visualise how the initial UCO just gets
morphed into byproducts.</p>
<p>I don’t think I understand the process enough yet to start
‘designing’ a model for it.</p>
<p>Jet fuel lies between the diesel and gasoline range, so a well chosen
catalyst is needed to not break things down to much (cracking) and
produce lots of gasoline while also breaking it down enough to not be
left with a load of diesel.</p>
<p>No more than 50% HEFA fuel is allowed in regular jet fuel mix to meet
the aromatic content requirements.</p>
<p>Why do we only care about tri-olein, linolein and palmitin? What
about the di’s?</p>
<p>My thinking is to represent the mass as a recursive data structure
that mutates throughout the process, or at least, any process reads a
recursive mass data structure as input.</p>
<p>I think I may be over complicating things with this whole recursive
mass flow notion. For now, could just have the inputs ‘build up’ the
mass flow at that time. It might be a matter then of testing it out and
seeing what kind of</p>
<p>This morning I’ll try and just get the whole process outputting the
right numbers. It’ll basically be a useless template program but
something to build on hopefully.</p>
<p>I think that the reason only triglyceride’s are used is that the
others have a similar mechanism to it so its used as a reference.</p>
<p>About 4 steps have the same energy release, The energy use is assumed
as that needed to maintain reactor temperature, not too sure how the
calculation is made, it divides the energy needed to get a filtered
cooking oil/2 multiplied by 1/4?</p>
<p>I’m becoming more and more convinced that basically all but the logic
in the report should be done in excel.</p>
<p>Frustrating morning, nothing to grasp on to.</p>
<p>Need to look at setting up a way to log daily notes.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>From yesterday, the operators should be really simple, as declarative
as they are in the report.</p>
<p>Changed the output flow code a bit.</p>
<p>Got something going, I mean hydrogen production is kind of just a
constant at the end, the same with system efficiency.</p>
<p>Planning to look through uncertainty standard this morning a do a
walk through with one of the input variables to a process.</p>
<p>An example of a design change would be, do we want to be able vary
the percentage of triglycerides? Do we want the mass inputs more fine
grained? Along with this comes the previous question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we only care about tri-olein, linolein and palmitin? What
about the di’s?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, could we work back to a distribution from a sensitivity
analysis?</p>
<p>Unsure as to how sensitivity operates in the standard uncertainty,
need to do further reading.</p>
<p>Next steps would most likely be to write some tests.</p>
<p>You and Your research</p>

<p>[[Creative contexts]]</p>
<p><em>narrow creative contexts</em> an emotional or intellectual thing
thats a driving force in what you’re doing. &gt; if you get disconnected
from it, don’t nurture and stew in it enough, don’t believe in it
enough, you start to lose contact with your project.</p>
<p>Jordan did this in creating a motivational context. Not entirely
rational to ‘take it personally’ but it was a driving forc for hi to do
what he does.</p>
<p>H posits that creative projects are primarily <em>emotional</em>
events, so its important to nurture them as this is often a very fickle
form of motivation.</p>
<p>I like the idea of tying the creative context to an <em>outcome</em>
or something to ship, that its <em>for</em> something.</p>
<p>This can simply be emails, twitter threads, blog post. He anchors
this need to ship in the idea of <em>sharing</em> that ultimately he
wants to share some part of that creativity he’s nurturing.</p>
<p>There’s a maniacal aspect to some creation, like a bottleneck, that
it needs to be ruthlessly tackled. At times, this is OK to accept too.
Relationships can drain emotional context and cause intellectual context
to fade. That’s OK but sometimes it isn’t.</p>
<p>My frame of mind at the moment: For me creative contexts are periods
where I’m really interested in reading about a topic and feel theres not
enough time in the day and too much to know in it. I think nielsen does
a great job here of defining it, I very much feel I can relate.</p>
<p>I’m also thinking of my own personal kms, in the sense of what I want
it to do fundamentally and how to leverage behaviour that may be
‘emergent’ from it in a system’s thinking sense.</p>
