This morning I'll try and just get the whole process outputting the right numbers. It'll basically be a useless template
program but something to build on hopefully.

I think that the reason only triglyceride's are used is that the others have a similar mechanism to it so its used as a
reference.

About 4 steps have the same energy release, The energy use is assumed as that needed to maintain reactor temperature,
not too sure how the calculation is made, it divides the energy needed to get a filtered cooking oil/2 multiplied by
1/4?

I'm becoming more and more convinced that basically all but the logic in the report should be done in excel.

Frustrating morning, nothing to grasp on to.
