Meeting with Stephen this morning, will see what his ideas are which will affect what I do this week.
Also, chat with Liam this week which will, once again, affect things.

The general model is the _fishbone diagram_. 
For this week I'll work on perturbation analysis, so moving variables by 1 standard deviation from the expected value
and seeing effect on outcomes.

Because each input has its own specific domain range (if its an rv) then its a further case that inputs should be
considered random variables. Or just have a special type of input?

Am I pestering Mark too much?

**What I have at the moment is moving within a ten percent range each input. A further refinement would be to take a more
'educated' guess on this range through assumptions etc. Given this, is it a worthwhile output?**

**What could be considered a 'finished' perturbation analysis (should I look to research)?**

Lindley defines the balls in the urn as a _standard_ like a unit of length, trying to intuit how far to extend this
analogy based on what I think probability (a mathematical model) is so far.
