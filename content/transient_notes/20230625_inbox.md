Try and organise two knowledge 'socialization' sessions this week. And prepare for them!

I think the jumping point between probability theory and the philsophy of probability is that probability is a form of
measure theory, measure theory is related to abstract quantities in the real world of interest that we implicitly
assign a physicality to, like mass and area. Probability, according to some people, does not fit this physicality of
'belief'.
