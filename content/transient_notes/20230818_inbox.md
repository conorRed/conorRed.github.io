## Research

I need to really simplify my points, I'm trying to do too much.

Definitely a bit fucking lost at this stage. It all just seems very incoherent, I don't know what they want me to say.

Losing sight of the structure I think.

I don't think I'm very good at spending time on the foundation sometimes. Just generally.

I'm trying to communicate this idea that any unit process or collection of unit process can be treated as a function.
The aim of an uncertainty analysis is to provided a probabiliyt distribution for the output of a function.
