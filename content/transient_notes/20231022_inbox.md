How do I make all my goals measurable?

I'd hope to use it as a practice exercise for programming or vim as well.


Goals for week.

* Read hanah ritchie on veganism.
* Read some consensus reports for heart health etc. for nutrition advice.
* Log three workouts.
* Work through dist. systems with Rust video.
* Look at building file server with VM.
* Start reading an hour a night.
