Really having a frustrating time with probability. Its really interesting but I just feel I should be better at it or
something.

I'm trying to understand expectation and variance a bit better as these are singular numerical description of
distributions across space. 

I'm also interested in transformations of measure functions. How random variables fit into measure theory.
