[[Creative contexts]]

_narrow creative contexts_ an emotional or intellectual thing thats a driving force in what you're doing.
> if you get disconnected from it, don't nurture and stew in it enough, don't believe in it enough, you start to lose
contact with your project.

Jordan did this in creating a motivational context. Not entirely rational to 'take it personally' but it was a driving
force for how to do what he does.

Creative projects are primarily _emotional_ events, so its important to nurture them as this is often a very fickle form
of motivation.

I like the idea of tying the creative context to an _outcome_ or something to ship, that its _for_ something.

This can simply be emails, twitter threads, blog post. He anchors this need to ship in the idea of _sharing_ that
ultimately he wants to share some part of that creativity he's nurturing.

There's a maniacal aspect to some creation, like a bottleneck, that it needs to be ruthlessly tackled. At times, this is
OK to accept too. Relationships can drain emotional context and cause intellectual context to fade. That's OK but
sometimes it isn't.

For me creative contexts are periods where I'm really interested in reading about a topic and feel theres not enough
time in the day and too much to know in it. Nielsen does a great job here of defining it, I very much feel I can
relate.
