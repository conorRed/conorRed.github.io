Getting ready for the Aurora interview:

How do I figure out what it would be like to work there?
    What are the expectations in working outside hours? 
    Are their retrospectives to work on what could be done better?
    What might a typical day look like?
What is Aurora's vision as a company?
    What is Aurora's overall mission statement?
    Are most people invested in Aurora's overall mission?
Company culture?
    Are employees supported (wrt. to profits, customers)?
    Are there opportunities to up skill and learn internally, about the energy sector or otherwise?
