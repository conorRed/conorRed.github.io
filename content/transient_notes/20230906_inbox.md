I think I need a way to represent the oil throughout the processes, this is the mass that never changes just gets
rearranged, it would be handy if all processes had access to it. **For any process we want to know its energy and the
composition of the production (where all the masses are, because its a mass balance), the mass flow.**

I'm finding it hard to visualise how the initial UCO just gets morphed into byproducts.

I don't think I understand the process enough yet to start 'designing' a model for it.

Jet fuel lies between the diesel and gasoline range, so a well chosen catalyst is needed to not break things down to
much (cracking) and produce lots of gasoline while also breaking it down enough to not be left with a load of diesel.

No more than 50% HEFA fuel is allowed in regular jet fuel mix to meet the aromatic content requirements.

Why do we only care about tri-olein, linolein and palmitin? What about the di's?

My thinking is to represent the mass as a recursive data structure that mutates throughout the process, or at least, any
process reads a recursive mass data structure as input.

I think I may be over complicating things with this whole recursive mass flow notion. For now, could just have the
inputs 'build up' the mass flow at that time. It might be a matter then of testing it out and seeing what kind of
