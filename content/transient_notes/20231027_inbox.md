There's this scene, in a 'Pixar Story', where the animator is discussing the symbolism of the fin in Findign Nemo. It's
just fascinating to see this extra layer that an artist approaches what seem simple. That this abstract idea, somehow,
imbues emotion into the scene. To be honest, I'm kind of inspired by it. I hope that one day I can look at the world
that way. To imbue the things I make with something more. 

This idea of catching the character, their essence, is really what animations all about. It's something that fascinates
me too I just never used it. Art was always draftsmanship, never creative, a technical activity.

Can one take the optimism and childish curiosity to any problem. To creating our future?
