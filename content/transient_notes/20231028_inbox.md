I'm trying to think a bit about bringing energy costs down. What cost competitiveness means for solar.

LCOE (Levelised Cost of Energy). The present value of building and running a generator over its lifetime.

> Electricity from utility-scale solar photovoltaics cost $359 per MWh in 2009. Within just one decade the price
declined by 89% and the relative price flipped: the electricity price that you need to charge to break even with the new
average coal plant is now much higher than what you can offer your customers when you build a wind or solar plant.

> It is very hard to find anything else that declines in price just as fast as electricity from renewable sources.The
report by IRENA finds that for the 531 individual items that are used to compile the UKâ€™s Consumer Price Index (CPI),
only five items have declined more rapidly: strawberries, fruit smoothies, internet computer games, household cleaner
and underground/metro fares outside London. But of course most people spend more money on electricity than on
strawberries
