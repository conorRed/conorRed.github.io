Trying to learn about Star Formation.

## Star Formation

It's hard to visualise but molecules in a giant molecular cloud have a gravitational interaction.

Is a molecular cloud an unsolvable three body problem?

There are so many particles that we treat it as a continuous substance. But surely theres a point at which the density
is so low that its an n-body problem.

In a star gravity is constantly pushing for greater and greater density. The outward pressure gradient is what keeps
this relentless force at bay.

Molecules, if they can't lose their kinetic energy they release it as radiation (light). As you compress a gas, it heats
up. When the kinetic energy of particles is no longer that high, the continued compression is released in the form of
radiation.

There are around $10^9$ particles $m^3$ in an interstellar cloud. It's about $10^14$ km in size. It's 'surface'
temperature is about 10K. Compared to a cloud particle/protostar which has a particle density of $10^24/m^3$ and 3000K

When the core temperature gets to about 10000K central temperature its outward pressure starts to balance and approach
hydrostatic equilibrium.
