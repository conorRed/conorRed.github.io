Could I look at just 'building' processes from the mass flow? through Jupyter notebooks

* Need to update rolling brief using Marks's feedback.

Want a way so that if I have a file that 'creates' the whole fuel production flow, its just an easier way of not writing
it out line by line on the console. 

Maybe the operator should in charge of 'building' the output flow? 

Its very imperative style code, partly by choice I suppose, but still, is this a good thing?
