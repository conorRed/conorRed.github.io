Well, I'm back. Kind of. Hoping to get a bit more specific on my workout goals.
* Calistenics. Basic progression for muscle ups.
* Squat, mobility.
* BJJ.
* Grip strength.

I'm hoping to leverage my notetaking to keep in touch with the 'why' of each exercise. How it relates to my goals. Maybe
a hyperlink?

I'm trying to get a program and be able to tweak it. Or, know why I'm doing the sets and reps I'm doing.

* Starting w/ beginner plan from OG. Important to build a solid foundation.
* Going to use grip strength as a case study for building strength. 

Generally, the body adapts to the positions you put it in.
