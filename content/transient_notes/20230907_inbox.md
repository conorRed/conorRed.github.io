I've been rereading some of Smil's work. Its more understandable now. Smil's work is far too anti-narrative driven.
Which is ultimately very honest but probably why his work isn't more popular. He argues for energy as a core model for
humanities development. It's logical, but not always.

I'm trying to think of ways of forcing myself to write, or have accountability on book notes etc. I think making it
manageable is very important but also somewhat focused so that its not so vague thats its impossible to know where to
start. Maybe just an index of questions.
