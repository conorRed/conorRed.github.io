## Research

Continuing from yesterday question on the main points I'm trying to get across.

* There is knowledge abstraction. If all experts in a domain can simplify their knowledge to equations and probability
  distributions an uncertainty analysis can easily be integrated into the model development.

I might need to spend some time detailing why its needed.

When I'm lost, try just come back to giving outlines of each section.

I think there's merit in the point that generalisation to functions allows for easier integration of uncertainty into
model development. If you're an LCA practioner you just need to define a function for you unit process
