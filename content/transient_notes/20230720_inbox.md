Reading about Henri Poincare this morning. Didn't get much sleep so will crash at some point today I'm sure.

Dynamical systems, chaos theory, what would it mean to work in this area? I might need to make an effort to understand
complexity and chaos theory first 

I like Fellers analogy of a mathematical formalism to Chess. The rules of chess are very strict, they say nothing about
'why' a pawn has the moves it has, there is no search for intuition in chess. A similar analogy to probability measure
theory. Except, here, there is a search for intuition.

## Research

Logic structures ideas, it does not invent them (Poincare).

Does it make sense to use the mathematical approach to state what an uncertainty analysis is?
