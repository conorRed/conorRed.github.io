I've been listening to Sara Seagar this morning on Lex. They speak about UFO's and how people want to believe. It
reminded me of what @McCulloch describes in history of christiantity. That theres this shockwave of belief centered
around the resurrection there's no real reason why people started to believe it so fervently. McCulloch describes it as a
different _kind_ of truth. Maybe this different _kind_ of truth is that people want to believe that such a thing is
possible. Although it still begs the question why all the time til Christ for this to happen. Surely its not that novel
an idea.

Looking at color and representation

The main culprit is saturation, in terms of ugly colours.
