## Notes

* Interesting that by elections can show trends more so than general elections as you can't transfer votes to the same
  party. Dublin bay south
    * :politics:
    * Should show trends for the next general election
    * Could be a good place to start in exploring the likes of Labour
* article about Uganda trying to fight covid
    * What happens when you implement all Covid guidelines to stop infection and you still don't have enough vaccines.
      Just shows how little poll some countries have in the global scene of vaccine supply. Without the EU would Ireland
      be the same? Its kind of tragic but part of the world at the moment, not too sure what the make of it.

## Work

* Component equals service
