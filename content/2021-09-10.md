## Daily checklist

* [ ]

## Notes

* [Listen to classical music chronologically?](https://scaruffi.com/music/classic.html)
* The sides in the vaccination debates are tiring. I don't what to do apart from my own research which just defeats the
  purpose of experts.
* [On why rationality wont save the world, or me for that matter](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/)
    * "The point of winning is not to make money, or gain influence, or even to altruistically produce more QALYs. The point
      is that for my reality to even feel legitimate, it needs to have bearing on the consensus shared reality."
* Inadequate Equilibria
* [Liu Cixin](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/24/liu-cixins-war-of-the-worlds)
    * His stories are in some exams
      "When a reporter recently challenged Liu to answer the middle-school questions about the “meaning” and the “central
      themes” of his story, he didn’t get a single one right. “I’m a writer,” he told me, with a shrug. “I don’t begin with
      some conceit in mind. I’m just trying to tell a good story.”"

    * Competitiveness and status guiding our career decisions. The reason to do something is obfuscated.
    * People are motivated to affiliating with high status individuals
