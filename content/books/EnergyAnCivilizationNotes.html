                is a fundamental property of the universe</h3>
                <p>In Science, to model the world, things to be examined
                are broken down into <em>systems</em>. A ball and the
                Earth is a system, the universe can be a system. The
                idea is that at some point you have the things you’re
                interested in and those that you’re not. It’s the
                spherical cow notion. For a system we define a measure
                of that system called <em>Energy</em>. This is a
                numerical value that’s a property of the system.</p>
                <p>Energy is transferred between systems and there is a
                symmetry to the transfer. If I lose heat, my
                surroundings gains that heat. This does not apply on the
                scale of the system of all systems i.e. the universe due
                to relativity and other shit. We’re left with this
                quantity that can’t be created or destroyed just
                transferred about the place.</p>

                id="creating-our-own-conversions-and-flows-of-energy">Creating
                our own conversions and flows of energy</h3>
                <p>What really stuck out to me in this chapter was the
                idea of conversions. What makes humans special is our
                ability to make our own converters. All animals got one
                from evolution (the metabolism) and we’ve been able to
                make our own (like steam engines).</p>
                <p>Smil states that the metabolism inherentely limits
                the kinetic energy of working muscles. This makes sense
                if thought of as a work engine with some efficiency. The
                conversion process of our metabolism has some finite
                performance (efficiency).</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>Animate metabolism reorganizes nutrients into growing
                tissues and maintains bodily functions and constant
                temperature in all higher species. Digestion also
                generates the mechanical (kinetic) energy of working
                muscles. In their energy conversions, animals are
                inherently limited by the size of their bodies and by
                the availability of accessible nutrition. A fundamental
                distinguishing characteristic of our species has been
                the extension of these physical limits through a more
                efficient use of muscles and through the harnessing of
                energies outside our own bodies.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Humans have been the only animal to really go beyond
                this with tool use and brain power to access <em>extra
                somatic</em> forms of energy.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Important here is the processes involved in
                accessing these extrasomatic energies. For instance, the
                harness was an artifact that was used to do this. In
                some cases, like irrigation its reliant on information
                flow to organise large structures.</li>
                <li>Smil extends this to more modern ideas of things
                conductive to basic research like education, legal
                arrangements, access to capital and basic economic
                rules. This sense of reliability and foundation allowed
                the creation of knowledge to tap into extrasomatic
                energies.</li>
                <li>He uses a flow analogy for human ingenuity and that
                the above can be seen as valves to open these
                flows.</li>

                <p><em>Power density</em> the rate at which energy is
                produced or consumed per unit area. For an 18th century
                city that required fuel for making goods, cooking and
                heating it required about 20 - 30 W/m^2. Even really
                fast growing fuel wood could not match this power
                density unless it’s area was massive. ??? Needs more
                work.</p>
                <p>Energy density is easy to intuit. An energy dense bar
                vs some carrot sticks on a hike, or the energy density

                says that to provide 800MW of power requires 16ha of

                4923 W/m2. Detailing how much power we extract from a m2
                of land in the best case- a useful measure. It’s a power
                to land ratio, how efficient our land use is. The higher

                toward time, work, and nature and helped stabilize
                populations at higher densities. The need to plan and
                budget time was perhaps the most important evolutionary
                benefit. This new mode of existence precluded frequent
                mobility and introduced a different way of subsistence
                based on surplus accumulation. The process was
                self-amplifying: the quest for the manipulation of an
                ever larger share of solar energy flows set the
                societies on the road toward higher complexity.</p>

                <p>Boserup (1965, 1976) conceptualized the link between

                <p>These choices are once an agricultural system (land,
                community, no of workers etc.) reaches the limits of its
                productivity, people can:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>The last option seems like a no brainer but required

                <blockquote>
                <p>Increased productivity will support larger
                populations by cultivating the same (or even smaller)
                areas, but the net energy return of intensified cropping

                <p>To get more out the land, you had to put more in
                (work). This might not pay off.</p>
                <p>According to Smil, everywhere in the world was slow
                to advance productivity of the land they had. &gt;
                everywhere, it took millennia to shift from regular,
                extensive fallowing to annual cropping and &gt; then to
                multicropping.</p>

                <p><strong>Where the marginal cost to cut cropland was
                high, farming intensification increased.</strong></p>
                <h2 id="farming-intensification">Farming
                Intensification</h2>
                <p>Farming wasn’t necessarily immediately energy
                efficient so the energy explanation doesn’t offer much
                in the explanation of this transition. It does offer an
                explanation for the increase in population after the
                transition though with increases in population.</p>
                <p>We can use this as a stepping stone into Smil’s world
                though. His core thesis is that of farming
                intensification. This is something that led to more
                energy being stored on Earth and was driven by an
                increase in labour and capital.</p>
                <p>Historically, societies tried to develop ways to get
                more out of the land they had. There were three core
                features to this, common across the world:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>An increased use of animal labour.</li>
                <li>A focus on irrigation and fertilization
                systems.</li>
                <li>Multi cropping and crop rotation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It’s important to establish the commonalities across
                societies as it can give a sense of the core problems
                faced. There are 5 main steps to developing crops on a
                fixed land area.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Ploughing: Fundamental to agriculture. The ancient
                Greeks and Romans used a symmetrical plow but the Han
                Dynasty era China developed the first Moldboard plough.
                With thicker soil in Europe a plow with a shaper point
                and a surface (plough share) to turn the soil to the
                side was developed.</li>
                <li>Harrowing and leveling the ploughed ground.</li>
                <li>Seeding, which was done using a seed drill in the
                Mesopotamia since ~1300BCE but was still done with
                broadcast seeding by hand in Europe until the 19th
                century (this method is inefficient with large amounts
                of seeds not planted properly).</li>
                <li>Harvesting: The first tool being the sickle, that
                replaced basic stone tooling.</li>
                <li>Processing: Like milling the grain by hand or with
                animal labour or pressing of oil.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another trend in all cultures was a dominance of a
                cereal grain. The particular cereal depending on
                geography but in hindsight, grains seem like a solid
                foundation as opposed to tubers or legumes because:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The water content of tubers is too high for long
                term storage and requires large storage volumes.</li>
                <li>Tubers have low protein. Legumes have high protein
                but low yields. Average yields for US cereals is 7.3T/ha
                in 2013 vs 2.5T/ha for legumes.</li>
                <li>Fairly high yields, good nutritional value,
                relatively (as much as 5 times tubers) high energy
                density at harvest and easier to store.</li>
                <li>Particular species dominating depended on
                environmental conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                harnessing the horses power for the tasks farmers wanted
                it to do.</p>

                <p>p.76 total seasonal need of water is approximately
                1,000 times the mass of the crop e.g. 1,500t of water

                <blockquote>
                <p>The energy cost of human-powered irrigation was
                extraordinarily high. A worker could cut a hectare of
                wheat with a cradle scythe in eight hours, but he would
                need three months (8 h/day) to lift half of its water
                requirement just 1 m from an adjoining canal or
                stream.</p>

                <h4 id="fertilization">Fertilization</h4>
                <p>It’s useful here to highlight the back of the
                envelope calculation Smil has showing the marginal
                increase in yield or the <em>leverage</em> of labour
                with nitrogen.</p>
                <p>A good late Qing dynasty winter wheat harvest of
                about : * 1.5 t/ha * required just over 300 hours of
                human and about 250 hours of animal labor. *
                Fertilization took, respectively, 17% and 40% of these
                totals. * Fertilization hours are 51 and 100 hours. * 10
                t/ha of fertilizer which contains 0.5% nitrogen. * Due
                to leaching only half that nitrogen becomes available. *
                25 kg/ha nitrogen for crops. * Each kg will add 10kg of
                grain. So 25<em>10 = 250kg of extra grain. </em> 3% used
                then as animal feed. * I think what Smil is saying is
                that you get 200kg of flour (2.8GJ) for 51 hours of
                extra work (40MJ) of energy.</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p>In most regions traditional farming progressed from
                extensive to intensive cultivation: its prime
                movers—human and animal muscles—remained unchanged for
                millennia, but cropping practices, cultivated varieties,
                and the organization of labor were greatly transformed.

                carried on where land values are low in relation to
                labour and capital, which in turn means that extensive
                agriculture is practiced where population densities are

                This along with the development of more advanced tools

                <p><em>What does a purely animate energy world look
                like, what are its limitations?</em></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Societies that derived any kinetic energy from
                animate power could not provide reliable food supply or
                material wealth consistently to its inhabitants (think,
                medieval Europe). Power applied is driven by metabolic
                requirements.</li>
