<p><em>notes from book and youtube videos given by McElreath</em></p>
<p>Can I come up with a question to answer, maybe stellar formation?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, we’re trying to ‘construct a posterior’ based on data.
The prior is the posterior with no data. McElreath views Bayesian
inference from the scientific questioning lens. In his view our
parameter is a conjecture, which he relates as parameters to build an
estimator model that ‘generates’ the data we see.</p>
<p><strong>The notion is to create generative models from DAG’s or
process models. This can generate ‘dummy data’. Then we hope to create
statistical models that can analyse the synthetic data. Then you might
provide it with real data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 is to identify variables, variables can be the observation
vector or parameters.</li>
<li>Step 2 is to define a DAG. The arrows in the DAG highlight
functional relationships to be solved for.
<ul>
<li>DAG represents everything you believe about how to data is
generated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-mcelreath-see-bayesian-statistics">How does McElreath
see Bayesian statistics?</h3>
<p>Posterior distribution is the <em>whole</em> mathematical object, you
can try and summarise it. For instance, with intervals, there’s nothing
special about the interval.</p>
<p>It seems with McElreath’s approach we’re combining the model and the
variable inference approach our <span
class="math inline"><em>Θ</em></span> is some set of values that define
a generative model for data we have.</p>
<p>Tsitsiklis says that a fundamental disagreement in inference is what
the ultimate mathematical object we’re trying to arrive at is. In the
classical approach, the quantity we’re looking for is a constant values,
we don’t know it, but if we did it would be a point. In the Bayesian
approach this object should always be modelled as random variable, a
distribution across values. It doesn’t mean nature is random but my
subjective experience is it being an rv.</p>
<h3
id="what-message-is-the-model-of-the-garden-of-forking-data-trying-to-relay">What
message is the model of the garden of forking data trying to relay?</h3>
<p>For each conjecture that one has, imagine a ‘world’ of that
conjecture and see how prevalent the data you’ve observed in that world
is.</p>
<p>The more prevalent the data is in a conjectured world the more we can
scale up the plausibility of such a world. Or, the more we could say our
world is that world.</p>
<p>Things that can happen in more ways are more plausible, what Mc
refers to as the unglamorous applied probability. You want variations of
your model that are more plausible to come to the for. See, now that I
have an intuition that the model is a construction of parameters the
intuition makes sense, but it can be hard to really ground some of these
things in words.</p>
<p>Example: The Binomal Distribution will ‘count’ paths for you. Here
paths are the same as mathematical objects that Tsitsiklis would
consider and Fellers with his letters in cells.</p>

<p>In this context, the unobservable <span

<h3
id="whats-an-alternative-formulation-of-bayes-rule-using-an-example">Whats
an alternative formulation of Bayes Rule using an example?</h3>
<p>The common formulation is as such:</p>
<p>If vampires are very rare in the population say P(V) = 0.001 but we
have a test that says with a 95% true positive rate if someone is a
vampire. We select a random person from the population, they test
positive for vampirism, what is the probability they’re actually a
vampire?</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$P(V | P) = \frac{P(V) P(P|V)}{P(P)} =
\frac{0.001 * 0.95}{(1 - 0.001)*0.05 + 0.001*0.95}$$</span></p>
<p>We have to normalise by all the ways you could see the data (get a
positive test). In this case, you can get a positive when you’re
actually a vampire (0.001*0.95)</p>

<p>“Bayesian data analysis usually means producing a story for how the
data came to be”. A Bayesian model begins with a set of plausibilities
for each conjecture (priors).</p>
<h3 id="components-of-model">Components of Model</h3>
<p>Assign plausibility of p with the data (observables). We were able to
defined the ‘state of the world’ through one variable p in the marble
case (that is, the proportion that were blue).</p>
<p>The story as McElreath puts it is that we have to events, W and L.
Nothing else can happen. We are given a string of 9 events (in this
examples). Out of all the possible worlds where 9 events occur, with our
parameter p defining what is the case, what is the plausibility of the
string of 9 events we have.</p>
<p>A binomial distribution is counting the paths for you. For a given
proportion of water to land, it’s saying how many So we have some
variable p, that constrains our sample space. On determining a new path,
p is ever present. We have W, L which we might consider the data. The
observables. Given that</p>
<ul>
<li>Rethinking datum/parameter? Data is normally considered ‘known’ and
‘parameters’ unknown.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section">2.4</h4>
<p>Or story is we want to know the plausibility of p given some
observable W out of N tosses.</p>
<p>The binomial distribution gives us a set of plausibilities for
P(W,L|p). We just want this for every p.</p>
<p>The initial goal was to determine which conjecture, out of a set of
conjectures was the most plausible given some data. In the marble
example, we had 4 possible conjectures. Moving on to the globe example,
the conjectures are all the possible states of the world (literally),
this state is defined by the proportion of water to land.</p>
<p>Plausibility for a given conjecture is proportional to the
plausibility of the data given the state of the world is our conjecture
times the plausibility of that world being the case (prior).</p>
<p>This prior can also be thought of as the prior number of paths (for
some previous data say). So it’s just counting paths.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-1">Chapter 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Small world vs large world. The example of Behaim’s globe is used
(it doesn’t have the Americas in it). While the small world model is
internally consistent is doesn’t represent reality fully. It’s this
interplay between your small world (model) and reality thats
important.</li>
<li>Follows on here from the Bayesian inference explanation above.
Looking at the garden of forking paths in which alternative events are
cultivated as we learn what did happen some of these alternatives are
pruned. In the end what remains, is what is logically consistent with
our knowledge</li>
<li>Counting the possible paths then becomes a multiplication of the
possible paths on each ring (in the example)</li>
<li>Marble example (I think p here is just a way of numerically
describing the no. of blue marbles)
<ul>
<li>A conjectured proportion of blue marbles <strong>p</strong> is
usually called the <strong>parameter</strong> value. It’s just a way of
indexing possible explanations of the data.</li>
<li>The relative number of ways that a value <strong>p</strong> can
produce the data is usually called the <strong>likelihood</strong>. It
is derived by enumerating all the possible data sequences that could
have happened and then eliminating those sequences inconsistent with the
data</li>
<li>The prior plausibility of any specific <strong>p</strong> is the
<strong>prior probability</strong></li>
<li>The new, updated plausibility of any specific <strong>p</strong> is
the <strong>posterior probability</strong></li>

<p>2.2 Building the model</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a data story. A narrative of why we are getting the
observations. Viewed as important as it makes you think of the variables
you really need to consider, get a bit more exact about chain of events
(creating something hard to vary?)</li>
<li>walks through Bayesian updating, the amount of evidence we have is
embodied in the plausibility (straight line at the start vs complex
curve at the end). The final figure is normally shown but its important
to know that it is just an iterative development from the first
figure.</li>
<li>Some tips given for evaluation, they seem rather abstract at the
moment though with my current knowledge</li>
<li>Now we look at mapping some of the concepts from the previous
section to build up the model</li>

<h3
id="likelihood-function-1-the-number-of-ways-each-conjecture-could-produce-an-observation">Likelihood
function (1) the number of ways each conjecture could produce an
observation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because both outcomes (W and L) are equally likely, and independent
we look at all the ways our sample size of 9 (n) could appear to
us.</li>
<li>The binomial distribution calculates the relative no. of ways to get
six W’s with 9 tosses holding p at 0.5</li>
<li>Looking at the parameters to the binomial function p, n and w they
can each represent different conjectures once we can tell the likelihood
and what has been observed</li>
<li>In the sciences, the prior is considered part of the model, there is
no reason not to interrogate it like other assumptions.</li>
<li>Bayesian estimate is always a distribution over the parameters</li>
<li>Posterior is proportional to the product of the prior and the
likelihood
<ul>
<li>Count up all the ways you could see the data and multiply by the
priors (look at table for marbles)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grid approximation builds up from the marble example. With just 3
possible values for water (0, 0.5 and 1) 0.5 wins out with in 3 tosses.
If we bump up the possible values to 20 though we get a more accurate
display of possible values (posteriors)</li>

Suppose the probability of a positive finding and a false positive rate
thats very low. If the probability of the prior, that is the probability
of any hypotheses you posit in general being true is low, the best you
could probably do is 0.5 (in terms of the posterior that the finding
indicates the hypothesis is true). The lesson here being that no amount
of accurate instrumentation can account for bad hypothesis (or
explanations)</p></li>

a result from 9 tosses). The initial posteriors are multiplied then by
each sampling distribution and the final predictive distribution is
