The framework for this book seems to be our interaction with the past we have:

* An illusion of understanding.
* Seeing the past from the knowledge of the present (creating a narrative).
* Place too much of a focus on what we know.

## Platonicity

Something that seems to originate from Popper. But in general, this notion of forms creates a shared language for people
to communicate and reason about the world. We tend to channel our thinking about world events, to categorise and use
terms to simplify repetition of the same news or propagation of some theory.

## Scalability

The limitations of the physical world bounds Mediocristan, muscle gain, caloric intake, car accidents are all random
variables that accumulate, that the next additional unit with not cause some dramatic increase in the aggregate.

Scalable things, like intellectual propert: a shoe design, a book idea some piece of software can dominate a large
portion of some particular variable, say revenue.

I think the key anchor here is what's measured, the effect that these two kinds of things have on whats being measured.
This measurement is the random variable
