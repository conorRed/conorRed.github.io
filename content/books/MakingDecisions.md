# Making Decisions

The notion of a _spherical cow_ appears here. 

> We feel that our model contains all the details relevant to decision-making...pursue it and see where it leads.

The model is a set of decisions $d_1 ... d_n$ with a set of events $\theta_1...\theta_n$. Trying to formulate an
exclusive and exhaustive list of both of these things is hard. But trying can produce some useful results. 

# The 'Standard'

Chapter 2 is about a 'numerical measurement' for uncertainty. Lindley says that all measurements are in reference to a
'standard'. To specify the size of your garden, you would use meters, a reference to the length of a path traveled by
light in 1/speed of light seconds. A reference is a 'grounding', an agreed upon 'source of truth'. 

The _communication_ of probability is whats important here. When someone says, I think this event will happen with a 70%
probability. I can use the standard to get a sense of what that means. The 'mental image' is different for both agents
but there is a common understanding.

In probability theory, the number 'represents' a belief in the happening of an event. This belief can then be felt by
anybody by using the standard.

# The way Lindley sees probability.

> Probability expresses a relationship between a person and the world he is contemplating. Some have regarded this as a
disadvantage. In fact, the subjective nature of probability is its great strength, for it describes a real situation of
a subject, or observer, contemplating a world, rather than talking about a world divorced from the observers living in
it, as do some other sciences. Recognizing that two observers. p.20
