## What knowledge is?

> Knowledge unlike information, is about beliefs and commitment. Knowledge is a function of a particular stance,
perspecetive, or intention. Second, knowledge, unlkike information, is about action.

They take the notion of knowledge as _justified true belief_ more so on the _justified_ where they argue Western ideals
would be more focused on the _truth_.

Knowledge is created from information flow.

## Two Dimensions of Knowledge Creation

> Polanyi contends that human beings create knowledge by involving themselves with objects
> To know something is to create its image or pattern by tacitly integrating particulars.
> In or der to understand the pattern as a meaningful whole, it is necessary to integrate one’s body with the
particulars.

They include more practical elements like Johnson-laird 'mental models' 

## Knowledge Creation
@coates
The notion here, is how to create organizational knowledge. The why of that I think is related to why we have 'firms' in
the first place something tackled by Coates in his 'Theory of Firms'. In the case of why we dont just all operate
freelance and let markets dictate efficient use of resources.

> According to Ronald Coase's essay The Nature of the Firm, people begin to organise their production in firms when the
transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than
within the firm.

Just before the case study, its probably important to get some context. I don't really think Japanese companies are
unique in some way like that described in the book. This is based on reading 'How Asia Works' where a lot of skill
development in Japan came from overseas. Where I have no prior is further development on that knowledge. Also, these
practices might be so normalised now (in the whole evolutionary business strategy sense) that it seems unsurprising.

## Case study: Matsushita

By 1977, a the household appliance market (where Matsushita specialized) was saturated. Most people had access to TV's,
refrigerators and vacuum cleaners, the were just replacing them. This meant that profits were stagnating. You need to
make less and less of your products every year until eventually, profits dwindle and your company shrinks in size. Its
interesting that to maintain price competitiveness required some scale and that if you'd to shrink you might just go
bankrupt.

Also, other developing nations were industrialising and providing low cost competition.

The slogan to improve core business competitiveness and assembling resources necessary to enter new markets became 
> "Beyond Household Appliances"

They started by taking three divisions whose markets were maturing into a general Cooking Appliances Division. The hope
was to make a new hot product using the knowledge of all the integrated divisions. The initial issue was creating a
common 'language'. They did this with the creation of a newspaper for factory workers. The hope was to disseminate
knowledge from all divisions to everybody. The key here being _redundancy_ (the idea that knowledge needs to be shared
that may not be needed immediately) invading peoples boundaries providing new perspectives and information.

Think about this even in a personal growth sense, getting sources of information from a range of relevant areas can
provided inspiration and 'creative chaos' but it starts with no real intention in mind for what you're consuming, kind
of just swimming in the information for a bit.

So they had their company intention from the previous slogan but they needed a divisional intention. In the 80's they
went to scout out the daily lives of Americans. They saw that their diets were poor and that people weren't at home as
often (more women entering the workforce), they generated the slogan "Easy and Rich" where rich is nutritional and
tasty.

### The first cycle

Initially, a head designer came up with an ideal for what the bread maker should do. Rather than focus on technical
feasibility. The union of several teams on working together created an environment where the general question of what
home baking was to them could thrive. They shared tacit knowledge about this and tried to embody it in their designs.

It was general guided by the intention though, that its easy and rich. This first cycle resulted in a product that
really didn't meet the criteria at all but people were on the same general 'page'.

### Second cycle

This is when an engineer Ikuko Tanaka worked with a master baker trying to gain the tacit knowledge required to imbue
richness in their product. After some time she developed the notion that twist and stretch was key, another
externalization (analogy) that was communicated. Over a year of trial and error they developed a machine that captured
this and materialized it into product specifications.

The overall goal here was to knead the dough correctly, to justify the concept against the notion of rich. Through
socialization Tanaka gained knowledge about how to do this and tried to use analogous phrases to externalize this
concept to engineers, this eventually resulted in things like lining special ribs inside the dough case. The combination
of knowledge was to aggregation of what the engineers were doing with Tanaka's 'vision'. This resulted in a prototype
that met the 'Rich' intention.

The final stage was to reduce costs and this was done through the 'Chumen' method which reduced the need for temperature
control (not too clear on the details). They then faced pressures as market expected release would have to be delayed
but ultimately stuck to their initial intention stance.

It kind of feels like the squeezing of terms 'socialization' and externalization onto some things after the fact. It's
hard to say how deterministic the processes of socialization were to generating new ideas.

Whats interesting here is how it shifted engineer thinking

> The success of Home Bakery changed the engineers' attitudes toward new projects. Their experience brought confidence
and a desire among Matsushita employees to develop another innovative product. Prior to Home Bakery, engineers developed
products to compete within the company. 
>  After its introduction, the focus shifted to creating products with genuine quality that met real consumer needs. In
addition, engineers started to investigate the desires of consumers when developing concepts. Sano said, “By asking what
dreams people have in their daily lives and how they realize them, we can get to the next break­ through.

This is interesting in light of [Austin Vernon's software productivity post](../articles/softwareisprocess.md) where
businesses are made to fit the software rather than the other way round.

# Epistemology

This book opens with a general history of Western epsitomology vs Japanese epsitomology where western ideas are
associated with knowledge embodied in objects. The deterministic nature of objects and the sepeartion of our minds from
those objects.

> the Japanese had failed to build up a rational thought of clear universality, because they did not succeed in the
separation and objectification of self and nature

They say that the japanese see the flow of time as a constantly updating present. Many Japanese novels not having any
fixed time point and poems free from time perspective.

Later also noting that the Japanese language itself has a seperateness from individuality

> The ambiguous nature of the Japanese language thus asks one to be equipped with some tacit knowledge of each context.
>
The notion of the 'public' and private person not being the same in Japan, that 'you and I are two sides of the same
coin'.

## Knowledge in Management theories

Hayek

> The economic problem of soiety is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate "given" resources.. it is a problem of
> the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality.

The authors argue here mainly with the notions of knowledge creation, thats its not really discussed in western thought
just exists and is manipulated. They say that Hayek ends up with a 'static' view of knowledge that just needs to be
utilised.

A lot of this management history goes over my head but I think the codification and view of the employee as an
information processing unit is dominant. The move to get rid of rules of thumb in business in the early 20th century is
counteracted by the importance of 'human relations'. Chester Barnard tries to synthesise it with 

> the essence of the 'problem of organizing' according to Barnard, is to transform the actors who strategically pursue
> mutually conflicting goals into a rational cooperative system.

For Simon, implicit knowledge was nothing more than 'noise'. The logical content being more important than 'values' and
'meaning'.

> In addition, Simon viewed the organization’s relation to its environment as passive. He argued that the business
organization reacts to the environment mainly by adjusting the information-processing structure. What he missed was the
proactive aspect of the organization’s action on the environment.

Moving on to organisational culture and the development of the knowledge worker (by Drucker), that knowledge is central to an
organization.

>  The organization has to be prepared to abandon knowledge that has become obsolete and learn to create new things
through: (1) continuing improvement of every activity; (2) development of new applications from its own successes; and
(3) continuous innovation as an organized process. Drucker (1991) also points out that an organization has to raise
productivity of knowledge and service workers in order to meet the challenge

> First, the socialization mode usually starts with building a 'field' of interaction. This field facilitates the
sharing members' experiences and mental models. Second, the externalization mode is triggered by meaningul 'fialogues
or collection flection' in which using appropriate metaphor or analogy helps team members to articulate hidden tacit
knowledge that is otherwise hard to communicate. Third, the combination mode is triggered by 'netowrking' newly
created knowledge and existing knowledge from other sections of the organizatoin theby crystallizing them into a a new
product, service or managerial syste.
