It makes sense to work from natural language as examples, after all its out of natural language that mathematical
notations is adapted.

P.9: Mathematical language, the ambiguity of simple terms like 'and' and 'is'. It's important to clearly see the
ambiguity and how the mathematical notation helps decrease it.

Sets allow a definition of defining properties to numbers. In an interesting example, we can define all the points in a
circle as ${(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 = 1}$. This is a way of translating the cartesian space into a set.proabbi

Often its inconvenient to write statements with set notation, but it is useful in some situation, like the geometric
one. 

When numbers are considered nouns, sets act as a replacement for adjectives. Nouns are constantly shifting in
classification depending on context of the statement. Will have to think about this a bit.

### Functions

_functions_ as transformations of mathematical objects.

If f(x) is a function then f turns the object x in object y.
