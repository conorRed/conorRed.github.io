Basic Economics

_Thomas Sowell_

# Prices

> From the standpoint of society as a whole, the 'cost' of anything is the value that it has in alternative uses. 

* In general, value as ultimately defined by scarcity. The value of one thing being whats given up for it.
* p. 10 resources tend to flow to their most valued uses?
* Prices are really trying to push for efficiency.
* There seems to be a lot of examples in the book. I'm still struggling to get comfortable with the notion that rising
  prices in a crisis might be a good thing.
* Prices as a signal that a good needs to be economised in the supply chain. An example by MRU is that an increase in
  oil caused a global supply chain of roses to develop.
* The price system is non deterministic in the sense that what outcome happens is unknown?
