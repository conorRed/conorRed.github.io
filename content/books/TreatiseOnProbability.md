Keynes proposes that probability is a _relation_ that a proposition only has a probability in relation to another. There
needs to be some reference point. He compares this to saying something is a certain distance away. You need to specify,
distance from what.

Keynes chooses as a reference point our own corpus of knowledge, the set of propositions that we hold.

> There is nothing novel in the supposition that the probability of a theory turns upon the evidence by which it is supported

On a definition of the probability of an argument, Keynes says that its a new logical construct, this probability
relation that seems to equate to degrees of belief in a proposition, just like notions of truth hood and falsehood or
logical implication. The notion of probability relation can't be broken down further.

The aim of the first chapter:

> Its object has been to emphasise the existence of a logical relation between two sets of propositions in cases where
it is not possible to argue demonstratively from one to the other
