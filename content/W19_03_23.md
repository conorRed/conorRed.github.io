Got close to nothing done in terms of learning this week, went home, had wedding, felt generally sad and had quite a
bit of anxiety (stress eating when home).

## Summary

* One thing, that I started looking at just before this is meditation. In two respects. From the health stand point, for
  my anxiety and stress levels and also just general exploration of the mind, consciousness etc. I've started having a
  look at Sam Harris' app.
* Got interested in Game Theory and 'Strategic Thinking' I spent Wednesday going through rationality stuff and 'Thinking
  Strategically' is recommended by Scott Alexander. I think generally training these kind of skills is something that's
  important. This also falls in the category of Anki and that. Just training my mind.
* Scott Alexander talks about Slippery slopes and the Chinese robbers fallacy. The notion that have to account for who
  you'll be when the option to make a decision appears.
* Got some more exposure with climate change stuff, nothing too crazy though. It's not been a crazy productive week.

# Actions

* Meditate every day. Finish the basics on Harris' app.
* Finish 'Thinking Strategically'.
* Anki card for probability theory.
* Notes on cog science, particularly identifying what I feel is interesting about it.
* Notes on ancient philosophy book.
