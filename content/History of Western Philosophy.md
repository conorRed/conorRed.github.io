    - 13 November 354 – 28 August 430
    - Rarely occupied himself with pure philosophy
    - His speculative views are influenced out of necessity by the scriptures
    - Unlike [[origen]] where platonism and Christianity lay side by side
    -  Thoughts on time and its three types in a subjective sense. Shows a high level of thinking
    - __CIty of God__ written as a counter argument to the power vacuum after the fall of Rome
      ([[?]])
        - Russell highlights the broad contrasts between the city of this world and the city of god
        - Damnation. Our ancestors sinned therefore we all die.
        - #Quote The punishment of all mankind for Adam's sin was just; for, as a result of this
          sin, man, that might have been spiritual in body, became carnal in mind
        - The need for lust in sexual intercourse is punishment for adams sin
        - Virtue relies on complete control of the will
        - This sense of judgement eternal by God.
        - This thought led to the subjugation of the western states to the Church [[?]] This along
          with the assimilation of the new state after the fall of Rome to Christian ideology
          espoused by St Augustine
        - Interesting table by Russell comparing emotional content in relation to [[Eschatology]]
          from Marx.
- 5th and 6th centuries
    - Only form of centralisation became the Church
    - St. Cyril vs Nestorius about the nature of Christ. The later maintaining that there were two
      persons in Christ, one human and one divine.
        - Boethius Consolations of Philosophy, interesting for the time period.  Should looke into
          more
- Gregory the great and monasticism from St Benedict which apparentely extended all over the western
  world except Ireland [[?]]
- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Gregorythegreat.jpg)
    - Pope Gregory Jose de Ribera
- P.365 reasons as the rise of the Popes power in the West
    - Combined imperial tradition of Rome with legends of martyrdom of Peter and Paul
    - Emperors in the Holy Roman Empire only became emperors when crowned by the Pope
- Donation of Constantine [[?]]
- After Charlemagne English monasteries were centered around by new civilizations that were starting
  in England.
- The dark ages were not world wide. From 600-1000 AD Western Europe was in the dark ages, but not
  the rest of the world. A lot of scientific progress comes from the East, built on structures from
  the West developed in the Dark Ages [[?]]
- John the Scot "most astonishing person of the ninth century"
- Ireland as a refuge for culture in the 6th, 7th and 8th century
- p.378 Johns writings on Platonic ideas __On the Division of Nature__
- # Mohammedan conquests
- 13th Century
    - Begins with Pope Innocent and Frederick [[?]]
    - Frederick made a peaceful conquest of Jerusalem which pissed of the Pope at the time who
      wanted a crusade.
    - Herectics in the 13th century. "The cause of wide diffusion of heresy was partly
      disappointment at the failure of the Crusades, but mainly moral disgust and the wealth and
      wickedness of the clergy"
    - Details several heretic groups
    - The church in the early 13th century was in danger of revolt, saved in large part by the rise
      of mendicant orders.
    - Founding of Dominican and Franciscan orders. Following thought leaders were part of this order
- St Thomas Aquinas
    - His thoughts became the accepted philosophical thoughts of the Church
    - Should look into his proofs on God, unmoved mover p.420
    - Very confused. Gods will is his essence
    - So the essence of God or divine providence dictates all. How do we possibly contribute to it?
      does evil affect it?
    - "By mortal sin a man forfeits his last end to all eternity, and therefore eternal punishment
      is his due"
    - "Man needs grace to persevere in good, but no one can merit divine assistance"
    - No reason can be attained as to who is elected and go to heaven. Baptism is needed though, in
      according with the scriptures.
    - Heavily influenced by Aristotle
    - "Before he begins to philosophise, he already knows he truth" not true philosophy
- Just in reading accounts of the thoughts of different Franciscan schoolmen all there influences
  are like tributaries or something, Aristotle mixed with plato mixed with plagiarism it makes sense
  but just interesting to see
- 'principle of individution' for two 'things' say, of the same species, can the be said to have
  different essences if identical in a material sense. St thomas says that they are different in the
  immaterial sense, not the material. Duns Scotus says that there are always differences. p.431 in a
  more modern sense.
- Character of opposition to the Pope changed at this time, becoming more democratic as opposed to
  just siding with the emperor.
- "Dante's thought is interesting, not only in itself, but as that of a layman; but it was not
  influential, and was hopelessly out of date."
- William of Occam if everything in some science can be interpreted without assuming this or that
  hypothetical entity, theres is no grounds for assuming it.
    - Occam on logic interesting enough p.436 very confused
- Asiatic religions taking over greek.
    - Details influences that led to Christianity really crazy, priesthood from the east, sacred
      book from the Jews etc.
    - Christian philosophy was enriched by contact with Constantinople and the Mohammedans Aristotle
      came to be known in the west
- Very confused by history of the schism, start of Protestantism and Wycliffe, start of the modern
  world.
- {{[[TODO]]}} Frederick II
- {{[[TODO]]}}  Byzantine empire fall of Church
- Modern thought
    - Can define it as the time when the state started to define culture as opposed to the church
    - Enter a new authority, science, both its theoreticla and practical aspects. The practical
      importance first recognised in connection with war.
        -  #Quote The triumph of science has been mainly due to its practical utility, there has
           been an attempt to divorce this aspect from that of theory, thus making science more and
           more a technique, and less and less a doctrine as to the nature of the world.
    - Emancipation from the church led to the growth of individualism
    - Russell says that the renaissance in Italy around the time of Machiavelli had an anarchic
      character, it wasn't sustainable but the freedom of though is evident.
    - This intro should be reread p..450
    - Power conferred by science is social. "an average individual wrecked on a desert island could
      have achieved more in the seventeenth century than he could now"
    - The power conferred by science is scattered. Its all about means as opposed to ends. This is
      also a form of madness Russell says, like subjectiveness. It is a madness that needs a
      philosophy russell says.
- Italian Renaissance
    - Italy had just powerful states between the 13th and 15th century
    - Venice was mercantile, Florence really civilized. Ruled by the Medici's late 15th century.
      Seems like an interesting enough period.
    - Pope became more of a head of culture for Italy. Encouragement of humanism until the victory
      of the counter reformation and Spain the Italian Renaissance ended.
    - The Renaissance broke down the scholastic system (the idea of a wrote philosophical model
      [[?]])
    - "The first effect of emancipation from the Church was not to make en think rationally, but to
      open their minds to every sort of antique nonsense"
    - Interesting, he finishes the chapter talking about the instability of Italian society at the
      time. "every stable system hitherto devised has hampered the development of exceptional
      artistic o intellectual merit. How much murder and anarchy are we prepared to endure for the
      sake of great achievements"
- Spinoza
    - Interesting chapter.
    - Logical monism the idea that logical the universe is all one. But the refutation is
      interesting. In that reasoning alone is not enough to determine the universe, to "successfully
      infer" the future.
    - His idea on metaphysics is interesting and comes close to what I feel is Christian philosophy
      Im familiar with. That are events or matters are part of a whole that stretches to the
      beginning and end of time. That finite things are a result of negation, some form from the
      void.
        - "The mind's highest good is the knowledge of God, and the mind's highest virtue is to know
          God"
        - "The wise man, so far as human finitude allows, endeavours to see the world as God sees
          it"
- Thirty year war and philosophical thought [[?]]
    - p.548 brief overview leading to Locke. The main thing I take away from it with my brief
      knowledge is the idea of resolving to have checks on the monarchy, to put more power into the
      nations hands while trying not to go back to the Cromwell style dictatorship knowing how
      brutal a civil war was. Refers to Locke as the 'apostle' of Revolution of 1688 "the most
      moderate and successful of all revolutions"
- Trying to wrap my head around Leibniz
- #Quote "__In the advanced countries, practice inspires theory; in the others, theory inspires
  practice. This difference is on of the reasons why transplanted ideas are seldom so successful as
  they were in their native soil__"
- The rise of separation of the executive and the judiciary, resistance of the Stuarts
- Locke says that people should that force should be used to overthrow the unjust and unlawful. Who
  defines this unjustness and unlawfulness? The party with the most power?
- Locke's principles of division of powers in their fullest application in the US.
- Finishes with noting how different things are after the industrial revolution. We are no longer
  talking about the individual as Locke speculated, its now about organisations. The division of
  property is not as clear cut. That state of nature still exists between states.
- I never realised the influence of Locke was so important. Russell details the differences in
  empiricism and thought of the time. Its also interesting to note what philosophies are 'taken up'
  especially politically by states given current circumstance.
    - Russell gives a general map of liberalism. The hard headed and the soft hearted both leading
      or developing into Stalin and Hitler respectively.
    - #Quote The stages in the evolution of ideas have had almost the quality of the Hegelian
      dialectic: **doctrines have developed, by steps that each seem natural, into their
      opposites.** But the developments have not been due solely to the inherent movement of ideas;
      they have governed, throughout, by external circumstances and the reflection of these
      circumstances in human emotions.
- Its interesting to try and be empathetic to the beliefs of the time. Russell says that Locke
  accepted Descartes' arguments for the existence of God, Berkeley invented a new argument but then
  Hume rejected metaphysics entirely, and held that nothing can be discovered by reasoning on
  subjects of metaphysics. Locke was game changing but still influenced by some beliefs of his time,
  just interesting to see how that developed. Also, I think empiricism is a very common view. Its
  one I have I think. It allows me to disregard metaphysics and general un-testable hypothesis. Was
  Locke just like that too, was Descarte or any general way of viewing things like a brick wall of
  thought?
- #Bergson
    - Bergson introduces this new classification of philosophy for the 'common' man. Where action
      and happiness are the ultimate good (utilitarianism ?) and knowledge just an instrument in
      this system.
    - Evolution is creative, its wants can be predicted but what actually results is unpredictable
