## Notes

* :career: [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVzvpo1aw4k&t=2877s) time more of a metronome, when anxious constently flicking back and forth at landmarks
  Get good at thinking about the problem, stay calm with the thoughts not keep the metronome flicking. Wade the waters
  and then notice anxiety and try and calm yourself. Ability to control time perception.
    * Feeling as the guide. Sit down and think about something you really dont like. Pay attention to what it feels like.
      Think about something you really like (doesn't really matter what it is) just get in touch with the feeling it
      generates.
* Relaxing of nervous system to switch context. Disengage to reengage.
* Using curiosity (genuine) to uplift and see beauty in the world
