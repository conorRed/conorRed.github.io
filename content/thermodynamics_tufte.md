# Ideal Gas Law

When we connect Boyles law with Charles' law and Avogadro's principle we get an interesting relation
called the ideal gas law

$$ pV = nRT $$

# Kinetic theory of gases

If we imagine particles in an ideal gas as solid balls that collide with the walls of a container
and eachother with classical mechanics we can derive pressure as

_derive this from simple model_

# Reversibility
