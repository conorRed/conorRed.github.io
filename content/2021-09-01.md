## Daily checklist

## Notes

* ["We think too much in terms of narratives"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoEEDKwzNBw&t=10s)
    * Telling yourself the good vs evil story lowers your IQ ten points or more
    * A conspiracy, an intention
    * If you here a story and think, that would make a great movie, be suspect.
    * "We need to get tough with X" similar to my thinking about housing developers, we need to get 'tough' with them.
      Thats lazy, its constructing the narrative that they have it easy and we are paying to price. Its the good vs evil
      story. I should be suspect of that opinion
    * Getting too tied in to your personal story, simple, a construct to 'get you out of bed' but they can often lead us
      astray.
    * Amazing how fundamental it seems to be
    * Do I really have to follow some kind of narrative? Why not just be messy, the way your life is. Epistemological
      hovering
* [Francis Hamel, Yellow Mountain](https://www.jmlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Francis-Hamel-Yellow-Mountain-2020-E-catalogue.pdf)
    * "Xie He in the sixth century said that ‘spirit resonance’ is the most important element in judging a painting. The
      energy passed from landscape, through artist and brush into the work"
    * You get that with the opening painting, as a whole it has a soul and then the minute parts, to me, not so much,
      its just one input, the painting as a whole, not its parts.
