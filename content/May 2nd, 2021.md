    - As opposed to not being 'special' it makes more sense to think of myself as human. Susceptible to biases and to causal cognition, in the sense that my environment affects how I think, whether I like it or not, whether I think im able to meta think or not.
    - What if the likes of Black mirror has the same prediction power in terms of extrapolation current fears of the future as star trek or any goofy sci fi that tried to anticipate the future? I dont think we know whats coming. I also think it will happen fast. I think system, especially information system will become so complicated that no one human will understand the whole system. We will need machines to explain it to us or just allow the machine to essentially 'own' it.
