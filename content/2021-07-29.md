## Daily checklist

## Notes

* "joy is a deep engagement with life", [Jonny Wilkinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O80qs9OEadw)
    * External pressures forcing solidity in your being. (figuratively)
    * There is no arrival. Where 'it' is. The idea of what your potential is, stops you from going anywhere. If you have
      an idea of what your best is, its a limit to your best.
    * :career:
    * Old ideas, defining what you think is meaningful. Whats important is completely arbitrary.
    * Excited about exploring these beliefs you hold. Uses analogy of trying to win a teddy at a fair.
    * High performance: explore, think about what you want, not what you need as the later is often determined by
    externalities.
    * Resonates a lot with my current position both in career and football
