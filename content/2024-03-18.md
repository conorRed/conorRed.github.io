Investigating growth models for writing about [[books/EnergyAnCivilizationNotes]]. A Malthusian
model has the form $$P(t) = P_0e^{rt}$$. It makes more sense, or is simpler in its differential
form. For any time step, its new population is some rate of growth of its previous population.
$$\frac{dP}{dt} = rP$$. The bounded form is the [[logistic curve]].
