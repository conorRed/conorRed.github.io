- After apply the plugin deployPipelines is configured 
    - Just project extensions in gradle we add the 'deployPipelines' with the container to project.extensions (which, is itself, a container)
        - "An extension object is simply an object with Java Bean properties that represent the configuration"
        - We can create our own types like extension, why not just create an extension object?
        - named managed types?
        - Property and provider types automate getters and setters for the property.
- [[physics]] [[calculus]] 08:01 starting again, 08:59 tough one this morning, lot of revision to be done
    - [[function]] are tools for describing the real world. In scenarios where a given variable **depends** on another. The temp. water boils depends on elevation, the interest paid depends on cash invested etc.
        - Domain of a [[function]] is the range of x values which can be different than the range, the range of y values.
    - [[trigonometry ]] [[radian]] defined as the number of __radius units__ contained in the arc $$s$$. $$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$ or $$s = r\theta$$
        -  trigonometric functions are just fancy placeholders for ratios. But they're actually mini [[function]]s because they depend on the angle $$\theta$$
    - Inverse [[function]]s where a one to one functions range becomes the domain of another. The logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function.
    - [[calculus]] is a tool that helps us understand how a change in one quantity is related to a change in another.
- [[thoughts ðŸ¤”]] #philosophical I was thinking last night, how much of a shock someone dropping an atom bomb declaring nuclear war would create. Everything we know, that we take for granted, would be gone. It's painful to even think about. There would be no pity party, it would just be a new harder state of things, everything that was, is gone. Similar to what we hope the pandemic doesn't cause.
- 12:20 Go through head first design patterns chapters. Right a read me for each. Set of questions. Write some exercises. Whats the deadline? work it out later estimate when given chapter. Im doing chapter 4 and chapter 11.

- Discrete mathematics
- Creating a gaseous mass at a velocity in one direction creates a force in the other direction
    - Chemical reaction gets more bang for your buck out of the gas
