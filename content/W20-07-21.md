# Areas

* Science. Im fairly certain I want to work in Science
* Discovering interesting things about the universe. This is a feeling thing. Much like maths, it gives me a sense of
  awe.
* Maths. I want to learn and really engage with maths

# Notes

* I would like to help people though.
* The counter, just do something. I don't think real innovation in an area comes from being general. It comes from
  curiosity.
