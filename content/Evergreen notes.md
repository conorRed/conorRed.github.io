## The Energy problem 

### Define the problem

* The majority of our modes of production in society are powered by **non** renewable forms of energy. (evidence)
    * http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JPM2021.pdf
    * "The US is still highly reliant on fossil fuels which account for 80% of primary energy"
    * "In 2020, China built over 3x as much new coal capacity as all other
    countries combined, equal to one large coal plant per week. China commissioned
    38.4 GW of new coal plants in 2020, over 3x the amount commissioned in the rest
    of the world. Its coal fleet grew by net 29.8 GW in 2020 while non-China
    net capacity declined by 17.2 GW. China initiated 73.5 GW of new coal plant
    proposals in 2020, over 5x the rest of the world combined"
* Developing countries can not follow this trend if we are to stand chance (evidence)
* [Energy innovation funding is probably the most important move ](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/johannes-ackva-an-update-to-our-thinking-on-climate-change/)
* > The world needs to provide more energy so the poorest can thrive but new need to provide that energy without
  releasing any more greenhouse gases - Bill Gates
 
* Scale
* Neglectedness
* solvable/tractable

## Notes

Primary energy is the energy thats harnessed directly from natural resources
