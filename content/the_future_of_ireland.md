# Initial thoughts
:thoughts:

* Like most questions, this strikes a chord at the very heart of culture.
* Theres an air of recalcitrance and apathy to the Irish, what is this? Why don't we dream, or maybe, why did we stop
  dreaming?
* I think its important to keep in site, 'the right answer' whether it be for
  housing, or an innovation hub or whatever.
      *  If there even is a right answer
* I'd like to reach out to some history professors or sociologists when I have
  something behind this
* Does the point need to be belabored about fundamental needs benefiting
  everyone? Can I explain it? [productivity](productivity)
* Try and temper the depth I go to, don't go too much into the weeds

# Questions I'm trying to answer

* Can Ireland become an innovation hub?
    * What is an innovation hub and what can it do for Ireland?
* What are the cultural obstacles for Ireland in the future
    * Say, in preventing housing
    * In preventing entrepreneurial individuals

# What is the goal of this inquiry

The hope is to look at ourselves and decide what nation we want to become.

# Structure

* Get housing over with. 
    * The reason we have a [housing](housing) crisis
    * What good housing looks like
    * What kind of policies will help us get there
