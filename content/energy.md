# JP Morgan report 2021 
:energy:
 
* US: 60% of transport energy is passenger vehicles whereas for China its just 25%
* Industry as an end user is massive in China
* In 2020, China built over 3x as much new coal capacity as all other countries combined, equal to one large coal plant
  per week
* Europe gas use in large part to imports from Russia, this has geo political issues. Theres a reduction in European
  production of oil and gas but an increase in imports.
* Is it about electrifying industry or creating some renewable source that can produce large amounts of heat?

# Education

* Trinity, masters of energy science, applications close next week, 24/07/21 14:14:37
* Utrecht, have two tracts which is interesting, applications for this year closed
* Somewhere in switzerland either ETH or epfl, applications open next year
* Oxford, ditto for applications but has the same cross school thing as trinity
* Computational physics might also be an option if the above don't work out. I might have a better chance of getting it.
* I just need to get my foot in the door I think. To learn. Gather more data.

## Is decarbonisation of the industrial sector negleted?

_Whats the criteria for neglected?_

* Dispropor


# Notes

* BTU: British Thermal Unit, roughly equivalent to 1.05 KJ. More or less equal to burning a single wooden match from
  end-to-end. Raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit, jesus christ god dam Americans
* Could computation help in discover for energy issues.
* Pilot plants https://www.eib.org/en/stories/decarbonisation-technologies 
* Could I get involved in EU or Irish initiatives for energy
* Energy Innovation (both invention and efficiency gains) requires adoption and dispersion
* Even if we get nuclear fusion in the next ten years (as Altman predicts) will it be in time. Or is it impossible to
  predict how quickly adoption occurs
* Is there anything I can actually do?
* Marginal productivity depends on what I can offer? And to whom?
* Making it easier to collect energy usage statistics? Through consumers? What benefit would that have.... none
* By all accounts I am not smart enough, nor do I work hard enough to offer anything. Why tf am I trying?
* Ok, so is industrial decarbonisation neglected?
* I think I'd like to be in a role where I can get answers to questions that are important. So that people (icnluding
  myself) could use those answers to do something. This is where writing, making a claim and then trying to figure it
  out comes in. Maybe thats the next step for me to develop insight.
    * Maybe this is what I should be doing right now, not studying Physics
    * How does one analysis scientific data
    * What is good evidence
    * Correlation vs causation
    * All these tools I'm a rookie at.
