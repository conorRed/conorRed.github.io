# Indo European

* The current prevailing origin story for the parent Proto Indo European is the Kurgan hypothesis that it originated
  somewhere in a tribe in about 3000BC on the pontic steppe.
* The oldest records are isolated Hittite words and names – interspersed in texts that are otherwise in the unrelated
  Old Assyrian Akkadian language, a Semitic language – found in the texts of the Assyrian colony of Kültepe in eastern
  Anatolia in the 20th century BC
* all members are presumed descendants of a common ancestor Proto indo European
