- [[physics]] [[riemann sum]]  Partition of a continuos function over the interval $$[a, b]$$ into n
  sub partitions. The **norm** is the maximum width of the n sub partitions
    - The riemann sum for right hand point in sub interval. Could also be an arbitrary point in the
      sub interval $$c$$ $$S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n}f(a + k\frac{(b - a)}{n})\times(\frac{b - a }{n})$$
    - The limit of any Riemann sum is always taken as the norm of the partitions approaches zero and
      the number of subintervals goes to infinity.
    - [[Leibniz]] envisioned an infitied sum of function values multiplied by infinitesimal
      subintervals of dx. So $$f(x)$$ represents a continuous selection of function values (as
      opposed to $$f(c_k)$$). The symbol then for $$J$$ (the definite integral that is approached by
      the [[riemann sum]]) is $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$$
    - f is integrable over $$[a, b]$$ if the [[riemann sum]] converges when the norm goes towards 0.
    - $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n}f(c_k)(\frac{b - a }{n})$$
    - The variable dx represents the real numbers in the closed interval $$[a, b]$$. Called the
      __dummy variable__
- [[Lex Fridman]] #podcast [[Max Tegmark]] the value alignment problem as being a fundamental issue
  for symbiosis or complimentary AI
    - [[thoughts ðŸ¤”]] computers as the get closer to modelling the brain. Similar to [[Licklider]]
      with dynamic models of the brain, cooperative problem solving.
        - You have this ability to not take into account evolutionary self replication traits etc.
          when developing AI. Kind of like developing with vacuum tubes vs transistors the
          architecture could change completely.
- [Interesting video by this kid about studying and
  drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kICh_d6tHQk)
    - Similar situation to myself
    - Prioritise how deep you can get with study
    - Its great to think that younger people can develop a mindset like this so early, the potential
      is immense.
    - It does take a hit socially.
- Joe Rogan Shanna Swan on endocrine disruption from the following article "The truth is, these
  reproductive health effects are interconnected,Â __and__Â they are largely driven by a common cause:
  the presence of hormone-altering chemicals (a.k.a.,Â [endocrine-disrupting
  chemicals](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm), or EDCs) in our
  world. These hormone-hijacking chemicals, which include phthalates, bisphenol A, and flame
  retardants, among others, have become ubiquitous in modern life. Theyâ€™re in water bottles and food
  packaging, electronic devices, personal-care products, cleaning supplies and many other items we
  use regularly. And they began being produced in increasing numbers after 1950, when sperm counts
  and fertility began their decline."
    - {{[[TODO]]}} The damaging affects of plastic, its interesting to see how we will solve this
      over the next century. Its a space I should look into
    - Check recycling code of plastic. 4,5,1,2 all the rest are bad for you. **Do not microwave food
      in plastic.**
- Earth day, need to keep the faith. Move forward solve problems, dont give up.

    - Why did I feel I needed this conversation?
        - I think John could offer maybe his thoughts on some questions I have
        - I dont really have someone to bounce ideas off or provide any sort of guidance in this
          area and I wanted to get the thoughts of someone from Ireland and Galway who I thought
          might have thoughts in this area and also with your involvement in the Portershed.
    - What am I hoping to get out of this conversation?
        - John's views on the current state of technology, both globally and in Ireland,
          specifically in the startup area and around energy?
        - Is there a space there for someone like me?
        - His views on the States, trying to find some sort of community solving problems there. Is
          it needed?
        - Is it feasible to do some sort of masters program in Physics?
        - advice on getting into the right groups?
