- #DailyThoughts Listening to Avi Loeb on the Lex Fridman podcast. He talks about our expectation or hope for reality as opposed to what it is. The copernican style of nature will tell us what she is. The ultimate decider is what is, what experiment tells us.
- #DailyThoughts The last few days I've been inspired by pursuing physics. Trying to understand the world, specifically the stars. It just elevates me from things when I think of it. It seems to be a solution to all existential problems, a union of humanity to look through the Maya or haze of our everyday and see the bigger purpose or thing (almost like god). The thought of not living my life in some way to progress humanity forward just seems like a bit of a waste. How do I find a path in this direction?
