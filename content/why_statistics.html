      <h1 id="personal-philosophy-of-science">Personal Philosophy of
Science</h1>
<p>What is the ‘case’ is a powerful idea. The ‘case’ is physical
reality, at some moment in time or space. It is absolute reality, a
platonic ideal we deduce from out sensory experience.</p>
<h2 id="blind-men-and-the-elephant">Blind men and the elephant</h2>
<p>My intuitive feeling for what is the ‘case’ is best summarised by the
parable of the blind men and the elephant. Several blind men encounter
an elephant for the first time and attempt to understand what it is by
touching different parts of its body.</p>
<p>Each blind man touches a different part of the elephant—the trunk,
the tusks, the ears, the legs, and the tail—and based on their limited
experience, they come to vastly different conclusions about what an
elephant is. One might describe the elephant as like a snake (feeling
the trunk), another might say it’s like a spear (feeling the tusks),
while another might say it’s like a fan (feeling the ears).</p>
<p>It’s my philosophy that an objective reality exists and that a
scientists job is to explore that reality, to generate new knowledge
about it.</p>
<h2 id="rigour">Rigour</h2>
<p>One of my biggest inspirations is Carl Sagan. I read his work, the
‘Demon Haunted World’, to explore the supernatural, to become ‘excited’
about reality. I thought, ‘there must be more to reality than this
boring science’. Anyone whose read the book will see the irony in my
motivation. Sagan dismantles notions of the supernatural but maintains
the validity of the claims without the scientific method. The subtle is
‘Science as a candle in the dark’. This method is used to keep us from
fooling ourselves. Sagan pushes for humility but rigour in how we should
teach science.</p>
<p>This rigour is of vital importance. The failing of intuitive
explanations are widespread in popular science books. While stoking the
imagination is a great service, I also think these books do a disservice
in expectation of application for the reader. Reading about black holes
and using terms familiar to our physical ideas can feel like
understanding but leave an emptiness and inability to actually say
anything useful about a black hole or explain it to others.</p>
<p>In April of 2023 I started to self-study John Tsitsiklis’ course on
probability from MIT opencourseware. Tsitsiklis’ approach was to provide
rigour as well as general practical application. What fascinated me was
that when intuitive explanations didn’t work I would just try and learn
the formulas, to get a sense of the notation and symbols. This was the
mathematical object that described the phenomenon. No matter the
‘intuition’ you came up with to describe it, you could never truly say
more or less than the formula itself. Having this source of truth to
grapple with made me start to like to seemingly opaque mathematics. I
began to explore the formula, like a painting for what was and was not
allowed in my explanation to myself.</p>
<p>Take for instance the idea of a random variable. This is a real
valued function from the outcome space to the real number line. You
might feel, ‘well thats no explanation’. But that is what it is. The
number that faces up on the roll of a die is a random variable, the
outcome of a coin toss (provided we label heads one and tails zero) is a
random variable. If I had begun with seemingly disparate phenomenon, or
worse yet, never stated the mathematical object some would gain the
‘proper’ intuition while others would be left by the wayside.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-statistics">What is Statistics?</h1>
<p>Statistics is applied philosophy of science. Statistics is the
application of our understanding of how to extract information from data
and our understanding of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The raw material of statistics is data. Data is information from the
world, or reality. We might further define it as <em>evidence</em>
noting the definition of evidence as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>facts, information, documents, etc. that give reason to believe that
something is true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This data takes the form of numbers. There is a lack of ambiguity in
numbers. They only have one property. Numbers come directly from the
phenomena being studied whereas words come from the brain. Data are
natures evidence, seen through the lens of the measuring instrument.</p>
<p>This feedback is like that of touching the elephant mentioned above.
Striving to get a sense of what is the case.</p>
<h2
id="maintaining-practicality-with-a-healthy-dose-of-the-philosophical.">Maintaining
practicality with a healthy dose of the philosophical.</h2>
<p>I cannot but question things. At the same time, one needs to pursue
things. The methods of statistics are well known and some are
mechanistic in their use. I want to learn these mechanisms while
maintaining abstract notions about the fundamental task that statistics
is concerned with.</p>
<p>This approach allows the persistence of rigour while not forgetting
the empathetic, the ability to recognise the ambiguity of the world.</p>
