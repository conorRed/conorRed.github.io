# Power Systems

_electrical power systems course_


* introduced the notion of 'energy slave' so equating the work from electricity to amount of work a person (at 100W)
  would have to do, or how much we'd end up paying them. 
* Can think of users (say, residential) as electric loads, putting resistance in parallel. Your usage in the home, the
  more things you switch on the more paths the same voltage source puts current down.
* Distribution of energy systems can result in inefficient power usage. You could have patches of overpower and
  under power.

* Is the demand/supply issue a really advanced pattern matching problem (ala AI, ML)?

* Power electronics is an _application-oriented_ and interdisciplinary area.

* SEAI energy show.
* Public services like lighting and getting rid of all the horse shit piling up on the street were pushed as problems
  solved by electrification.
* > "A combination of marketing, design and improved performance of gasoline based vehicles led to the abandonment of
  electric vehicles over their preferred lighter and more efficient counterparts."

* Inductance is the ability to store energy as magnetic potential energy.
* Back emf slows down current (negative pd). In a solenoid a time varying current varies the magnetic field which
  produces an emf.
* A current through coil one (with some number of turns) it can induce a current in coil 2 (with a different number of
  turns. Mutual inductance.
* Generally working in the micro henry range.
* He seems to care very little about what he's teaching. He's more bored than I am.
* Surely you have to see how boring it is to explicate an equation or derivation.

### Horizon Europe

* 6 general ares to improve upon. A good broad overview of maybe what area to go.

* RMS is the effective value. Very little understanding of what the RMS value actually is (from the professor). Wth.
* It's not automatically clear what advantages switches (even just as a concept) offers.
* Why do we need all these things? Like a dc to dc converter.
* Depends on application I suppose. But what application are we talking about?

* Generators are almost always used for electricity.
* One exception would be solar PV, where inverters are used.
* I'm going to be on this video recording.
* Magnetic 'yoke' extrapolation from wire around an iron magnet to rotor?
* Tilted rotor blades to promote a higher starting torque.
* Three phase is trying to maintain a magnetic field at a constant amplitude.
* Revolutions needed reduces with increasing poles?

* Using Kirchoff's voltage law for the charging battery example. 12V - 2I - 3I - 4I - 4i - 7I = 0. I = 0.5A.
* If you switch the battery, the resistance of the 4V is no longer a resistance. Power then delivered by 12V is going to
  be 12W delivering 4W to the other battery (but being drained at 4W). So both batteries are being drained and just
  heating everything up.
* Max power for a wire is limited by its thermal properties.
* Spintronics notion that you could transfer information through spin of electrons in a wave like form. There would be
  no transfer of matter, just a wave.
* Whetstone bridge, 3 equations 3 unknowns with voltage law. First law to label all currents, use three loops to get 3
  voltage equations.

* Linear power supplies are inefficient. Because they can only output voltages smaller than their input.
* Basic switch can be implemented with MOSFETs. 
* Are we just building up to how to make good IC's?
* 3 main dc to dc converters. Buck (step down), Boost, buck-boost.
