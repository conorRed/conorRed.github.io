## Notes

* [The rising middle class' contribution to the climate crisis is different than you'd think](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-newsletter-24)
    * >  It is not the development aspirations of the global poor that are driving the climate crisis, but the relentless
      increase in the already excessive consumption of the more affluent half of the world's population and particularly
      that of the top 10 and top 1 percent.
    * > Of the increase in global emissions between 1990 and 2015 half is accounted for by China. Two thirds of that is due
      to the Chinese middle class. One third down to the Chinese top 10 percent. Those are by far the most dynamic elements
      in the global emissions map. Other hot spots include the top 10 percent of the population in the Middle East and North
      Africa and the same group in North America. Rising emissions in India and the rest of Asia contribute almost a quarter
      of the overall growth but growth is spread across the income distribution.
