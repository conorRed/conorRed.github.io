How do smart people make smart decisions? #Gerd-Gigerenzer #career

- The best decision under risk is not the best decision under uncertainty.
- heuristics are indispensable, not a product of a flawed mental system.
- complex problems do not require complex solutions.
- more information, more time, is not always better.

I remember Babara Oakley talking about just memorising equations. Think this makes sense as you have
this ingrained equation and try and apply it to experience to really get familiar with it.
