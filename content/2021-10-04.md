## Notes

* [On the origins of marriage, reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/q0qju0/when_did_marriage_become_a_standard_of_human/)
    * Linked https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch02.htm
    * For some reason I find the tribal unity argument hard to except, it just seems like a real non obvious way to
      unite tribes, I don't know why I think that. Could it be a genetic (instinctive thing). Maybe it was used because
      it was something already in effect that most homo sapiens were familiar with. aka not its origins.
    * > The general pattern has been that humans like to form relationships, and that there was almost always a cultural
      tradition acknowledging those relationships between the people in the relationship and between the relationship
      members and the rest of society.
