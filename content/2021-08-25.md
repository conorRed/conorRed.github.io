## Notes

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jhwA1vLEpU Noam Chomsky on startups
    * I think his point being that a large part of the innovation that the likes of Silicon Valley depends on were state
      development. Commercialised by the Jobs and Gates of the world. I think his point isn't to blow the entrepreneurship
      of it out of scope. Interesting that he says that private capital isn't interested in markets they want a nanny state
      that procures what the develop.
