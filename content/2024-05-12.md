What are the threads of thought currently. I need to move on from this notion that I need more time
to think.

What would have to happen for me to be settled, or content with relaxing on a Sunday or 'wasting
time'?

If I feel I'm stuck for time, how do I get more? No social media on phone etc.

One of the crucial components would be weekly reviews. So that I can plan my week and also have
comfort that everything can be re-evaluated.
