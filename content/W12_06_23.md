Trying to focus on finish programming course this week and getting some hacky version of the whole fuel production
process coded.

Gym, I was fairly groggy, so maybe not the greatest session. Pancakes and coffee for breakfast though so thats good!

In the office today, hopefully works out OK.

Struggling to get any rhythm going this week so far. Hopefully I can change that today. Ate too much muesli for
breakfast. Gym went fine.

Working on directing development of the code towards main areas of uncertainty analysis, whatever that means.

Need to start making the change in my focus myself though, not just going to magically happen.
