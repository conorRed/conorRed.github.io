Socrates unites the idea of the good life with what you should do. What you should do is embody practical wisdom of
ethical matters. 

  > the love of wisdom transforms the soul so that it functions in a way that can be expected to result in a good life.
  This functioning must be identified, and Socrates identifies it as the expertise in the life of virtue. Now the
  problem of becoming good is tractable... To become virtuous it is necessary to have practical wisdom about ethical
  matters. p.58 "Ancient Greek Philosphy" Blackson.

We as humans should conform to standards of _virtue_ when asks what we should do. The good life is the happy life, the
happy life, to Socrates is the moral, virtuous life.
