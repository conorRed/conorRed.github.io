title: taxi drivers can be multidisciplinary

I love this idea from Taleb, that when 'learned' people frown upon a more abstract approach to things, or more
multi disciplinary he just tells them he's a limousine driver and suddenly it becomes more acceptable to hold ideas
across a range of topics. (I've a quote for this somewhere)

> Blue collars of the thinking business, they you that you are spread out between fields; you reply that disciplines are
artificial and arbitrary, to no avail. Then you tell them that you are a limousine drive and they leave you alone.
