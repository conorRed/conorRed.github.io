## Notes

* [Mike Tyson interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb1krIZJ7JQ)
    * Talking about fights and just genreal stuff. I think its important to understand and listen to people like Tyson
    * I think it deserves respect what he came through. To frown upon it is not to understand the situations of some people
      in the world
    * My feeling is that Tyson is a complete exception to people of his background. Almost like he's somewhat survived it
      and its important to hear what he has to say, to learn.
    * He's also seems in a constant struggle, which is real. I think often times we're afraid to face the reality of
      people, of ourselves. That we're constantly struggling and changing, we're not perfect.
    * Seems to identify with historical figures (like Pepin)
    * "History allows us to meet the future rather than foretell it" - Mike Tyson
    * The past is us in funny clothes

    * "For a man of his age, it’s a very . . . raw talent. It’s more like an eighteen-year-old running into the forest.” A
      costume designer complained, “He doesn’t know basic things about filmmaking, things that simply make it easier to tell
      a story. He thinks that these things will undermine his vision, but they won’t."
    * Maybe a push to do your own thing
