    - "__a crucial consideration is a consideration such that if it were taken into account, it would overturn the conclusions we would otherwise reach about how we should direct our efforts, or an idea or argument that might possibly reveal the need not just for some minor course adjustment in our practical endeavors, but a major change of direction or priority.__" used compass being wacky as an example
    - Having some evaluation standard that is fixed 
    - "Most of what the utilitarian preference cares about is stuff that we have no familiarity with." 
    - "So even though the future still exists, it just doesn’t weigh as heavily in a normal human utility function as it does for utilitarians."
    - Evaluation functions, what to weigh
    - "__ instead of thinking about sustainability as is commonly known, as this static concept that has a stable state that we should try to approximate, where we use up no more resources than are regenerated by the natural environment, we need, I think, to think about sustainability in dynamical terms, where instead of reaching a state, we try to enter and stay on a trajectory that is indefinitely sustainable in the sense that we can contain it to travel on that trajectory indefinitely and it leads in a good direction.__"
    - Uses the example of a rocket. We are essentially suspended in mid air at the moment
    -  A good signpost would strike a reasonable compromise between being visible from afar and also being such that we can have strong reason to be sure of its sign.
    - Didn't really finish but like the line of thinking, as much as I understood of it anyways.
