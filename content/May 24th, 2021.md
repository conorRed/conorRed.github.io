    - If you have a community of 37 node runners and 80000 passive listeners that check signatures and block headers, the attacker wins. If you have a community where everyone runs a node, the attacker loses. We don't know what the exact threshold is at which [herd immunity](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/08/17/philosophy.html) against coordinated attacks kicks in, but there is one thing that's absolutely clear: more nodes good, fewer nodes bad, and we definitely need more than a few dozen or few hundred.
    - The only solution to storage size problems is [statelessness and state expiry](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). **Statelessness** allows for a class of nodes that verify the chain __without__ maintaining permanent storage. **State expiry** pushes out state that has not been recently accessed, forcing users to manually provide proofs to renew it
    - [[Sharding]] what is it?
    - Interesting, this may be something missing from the high level discussions of Bitcoin, the technical aspects. That there are constraints and that maybe some of the inconveniences really matter.
