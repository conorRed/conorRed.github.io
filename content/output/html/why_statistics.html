                <p>What is the ‘case’ is a powerful idea. The ‘case’ is
                physical reality, at some moment in time or space. It is
                absolute reality, a platonic ideal we deduce from out
                sensory experience.</p>
                <h2 id="blind-men-and-the-elephant">Blind men and the
                elephant</h2>
                <p><img src="blind-elephant.png"
                style="width:80.0%" /></p>
                <p>My intuitive feeling for what is the ‘case’ is best
                summarised by the parable of the blind men and the
                elephant. Several blind men encounter an elephant for
                the first time and attempt to understand what it is by
                touching different parts of its body.</p>
                <p>Each blind man touches a different part of the
                elephant—the trunk, the tusks, the ears, the legs, and
                the tail—and based on their limited experience, they
                come to vastly different conclusions about what the
                elephant is like. One might describe the elephant as
                like a snake (feeling the trunk), another might say it’s
                like a spear (feeling the tusks), while another might
                say it’s like a fan (feeling the ears), and so on.</p>
                <h2 id="what-is-statistics">What is Statistics?</h2>
                <p>Statistics is applied philosophy of science.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>The application of our understanding of how to
                establish patterns about reality and put a measure of
                certainty on the existence of such a pattern in
                nature.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Data is the The raw material of statistics. Where
                evidence is defined as “the available body of facts or
                information indicating whether a belief or proposition
                is true or valid.” data is:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>nature’s evidence, seen through the lens of a
                measuring instrument.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Data takes the form of numbers. Numbers lack
                ambiguity. They have one property: their value.</p>
                <p>Imagine you are one of the blind men from the parable
                above. How would you describe what you feel to the other
                blind men? You feel a smooth surface, how smooth? How
                might another blind man compare the smoothness he feels
                with what I feel without touching the same part?</p>
                <p>What might emerge is a common unit of measure,
                another object to compare it to and say: “Touch the wall
                [or anything all me can touch] its about that smooth,
                maybe a little more, maybe a little less”. What would
                eventually happen is that smoothness and roughness would
                take on numerical approximations to this common
                measure.</p>
                <h3 id="statistical-model-informally">Statistical Model
                (informally)</h3>
                <p>All science relies on a reduction, or simplification
                of reality. This simplification is referred to as a
                system. It could be two billiard balls, the atmosphere
                of the planet or a neutron star. Its a portion of
                reality under study.</p>
                <p>If the system was the elephant. The data about the
                system is in the form of sensory experience with the
                blind men. All the blind man come up with what they
                think the elephant is based on this data. Each blind man
                comes up with a <em>model</em> of what they’re
                touching.</p>
                <p>Imagine that each man only measured one property,
                roughness, and had a super accurate way to do so, such
                that we translate each measure of roughness to a number
                on some scale. If all the possible models each man could
                come up with is just an animal defined purely by a
                roughness measure, the task becomes to associate the
                data measured by the men with a given animal/model. To
                compare the roughness measured with what we know the
                roughness of each model (animal) to be. We want to match
                the collected information to the animal (model).</p>
                <p>This matching process is uncertain. We can’t be 100%
                sure that even if all the measurements by the men
                matches the roughness of an elephant that its definitely
                an elephant but statistics provides methods to quantify
                how sure we are.</p>

                (formally)</h3>
                <p>A statistical model has to connect two distinct
                conceptual entities: data, which are elements <span
                class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> of some set (such
                as a vector space), and a possible quantitative model of
                the data behavior. Models are usually represented by
                points <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> <a
                href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

                <div class="caption">
                A general form of a statistical model. You can read the
                system here as an animal that has been hypothesised by
                one of the blind men.
                </div>
                <p>If we classified each animal above as a vector of
                points and the collection of these animals as a vector
                of vectors <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>.
                We consider the data as a vector <span
                class="math inline"><em>x⃗</em> = [<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,...,<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>]</span>.
                The goal is to define a function <span
                class="math inline"><em>Λ</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>θ</em>)</span>
                that assigns a numerical value, or measure, quantifying
                the relationship between that data and a given model
                point <span
                class="math inline">(<em>θ</em><sub>1</sub>,...,<em>θ</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</span>
                (which is the ‘system’ in the above diagram). This value
                would be higher if the data more closely aligned with a
                point in <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> (an
                animal) and lower if it doesn’t seem related.</p>
                <h2 id="pinning-down-reality">Pinning down reality</h2>
                <p>One of my biggest inspirations is Carl Sagan. I read
                his work, the ‘Demon Haunted World’ in my teens. I
                wanted to explore the supernatural, to become ‘excited’
                about reality. Reality as defined by science was boring
                and banal. Anyone whose read the book will see the irony
                of this goal. Sagan dismantles lots of notions of the
                supernatural in this book but maintains the validity of
                claims of the supernatural without the scientific
                method. The subtitle of the book: ‘Science as a candle
                in the dark’ summarises Sagan’s views of Science as a
                set of methods to keep us from fooling ourselves. Sagan
                pushes for humility but rigour in how science should be
                perceived in our culture.</p>
                <p>In April of 2023 I started to self-study John
                Tsitsiklis’ course on probability from MIT
                Opencourseware <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
                Tsitsiklis’ approach was to provide rigour as well as
                general practical application. What fascinated me was
                that when intuitive explanations didn’t work I would
                just try and learn the formulas, to get a sense of the
                notation and symbols. This was the mathematical object
                that described the phenomenon. No matter the ‘intuition’
                you came up with to describe it, you could never truly
                say more or less than the mathematical notation.</p>
                <p>As is quite obvious, reducing an animal to a set of
                numbers seems inhuman and wrong. This constraining of
                reality is reductionism. Breaking something complex like
                an animal down into what are its essential parts for
                differentiating it in reality. This is primarily so we
                can be unambiguous about what an elephant is, so that my
                idea of an elephant is the same as yours. To truly
                understand reality we have to remove our perception from
                obfuscating it.</p>
                <p>To make correct decisions, to strive for a better
                world requires having the best model of reality possible
                both for its own sake and for having accurate
                information to make informed decisions. Beauty and
                empathy for reality and its constituents (us) can be
                maintained in this regime. Balancing both is essential
                for tackling problems with multiple stakeholders, with
                no right answer but whose answer must be some sort of
                compromise.</p>
