                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/1IAwt1ORln4?t=1218">Why
                stagnation according to Stephenson</a></p>
                <p>As we become more cautious during a big project (like
                hoover dam etc.) we limit bad side effects.</p>
                <p>Wrt the innovation that seems to be taking place with
                computers</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>the amount of innovation has been unbelievable. It’s
                just been spectacular, and it’s because there’s so
                little friction.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                <p>Innovation in those areas is definitely amazing, but
                I think it’s had the side effect that if you are an
                innovation-minded person and you want to do something
                new, you always end up finding your way, sooner or
                later, into implementing whatever it is in software. And
                if you can’t do it in software, then things slow to a
                crawl, comparatively, and you’ve got to be ready for a
                lot of frustration and obstacles.</p>

                <p>“Stripe aims to reduce friction and expand global
                commerce by solving practical barriers”</p>
                <p>They try and promote autonomy. So theres some niche
                problem, their employees should go tackle it, get in the
                weeds. ‘Mundane’ things like sales tax or something.</p>
                <p>They don’t look for billion dollar markets, you look
                for 0 billion dollar markets. You try to create your own
                markets (Thiel). Much more in tech commerce is possible
                today than widely considered.</p>
                <p>A lot of business, looking for the profit pools,
                inadvertenly bet on economic stasis.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>the causal attributions that we give to things aren’t
                necessarily of sufficient memetic interest that they can
                survive in the ecosystem</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Given the choice between the interesting and the
                comprehensible choice, the comprehensible will survive
                in the zeitgeist. Reality does not have this
                interestingness bias. the mechanics of taxes, remittance
                etc. they’re not interesting but they’re not an less
                <em>true</em>.</p>
                <p>For Stripe’s there’s so many areas where gainful
                activity is just not taking place due to this friction.
                Stripe believe that the sum of these things add up to a
                lot.</p>
