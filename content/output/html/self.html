                <p>I believe most social problems (or those not worth
                fighting over ) in the world can be solved by more
                material wealth. For instance, if we could create clean
                cheap renewable energy, we can enable developing
                countries to leapfrog development stages. In our current
                reality, we’re asking some of these countries to climb
                the ladder of economic development with their hands
                behind their backs. From my viewpoint, innovating on
                clean cost affordable energy enables us to provide them
                with an escalator.</p>
