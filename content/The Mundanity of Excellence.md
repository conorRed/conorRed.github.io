## The Qualitative differences

- Attention to detail. The higher levels did not train more (qualitative) or trained, maybe 3 hours
  a day. The quality and intent of that training was high.
- They enjoyed the 'hated' parts of swimming, the tough practices and 'boring' details of strokes.

Moving through ranks is not a matter of quantitative accumulation but qualitative 'jumps'. Changing
to a new team, a change of attitude or discipline. If the kind of work remains the same, no major
differences occur.
