## Daily checklist

* [ ] Set up Anki
* [ ] Ordered book on cognitive science to better understand rationality, hopefully I don't regret it.

## Notes

* From [Gwern spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#using-it)
    * " if, over your lifetime, you will spend more than 5 minutes looking something up or will lose more than 5 minutes
      as a result of not knowing something, then itâ€™s worthwhile to memorize it with spaced repetition."
    * The dividing line between trivia and useful data.
    * Might be worth creating separate decks for just reminders of previous thoughts I've had
    * Gwern suggests inter mingling decks to keep things fresh
* Need to think about how I would like flow to work
* Frequentianism vs Bayesian ism the former is not empiricism as it hypothesises future experiments (It's also what we
  learn in school)
