Shows a few graphs to illustrate that co2 emissions have been fairly constant despite increases in
GDP.

There may be some amount of resource use and co2 emissions to grow but it seems that it can peak and
level out once a nation is industrialised. De growth counter this with the notion that this is not
happening fast enough.
