* Resistive electric heating can only provide as much energy as the electricity is carrying. A heat pump can deliver
  more heat energy than the electricity that it uses.
* The coefficient of performance (COP) is the ratio of heat provided to electricity used. COP decreases as the
  temperature difference between the hot reservoir and cold reservoir increases
* The physics means air-source heat pumps have the feature of being very efficient at mild temperatures. As temperatures
  get colder, there is a double whammy of increased heating demand and increased electricity usage per unit of heat
  delivered because of dropping efficiency.
* Heating economics favor high energy density fuels because peak demand is short and enormous compared to baseline
  demand. (?) 
    * Electricity production is capital intensive
    * People dont use there electric form of heating as it gets cold because heat pumps become less and less efficient.
    * There are more Heating days (days where heating is needed) therefore 
* Many processes exists to turn Hydrogen and Carbon dioxide into fuels. CO2 needs to be removed from the air, so if we
  can easily make hydrogen, could we make net zero fuels?
* Hydrogen production (through electolysis) is expensive
* Hydrogen from nuclear could work but faces a lot of overhead and barriers



 There are billions of people burning solid fuels that harm their health and cause air pollution. If cleaner fuels are
 available, they are often several times more expensive than what we pay in the US because pipelines and import
 infrastructure are lacking. Producing these fuels independent of creaky power grids and without extensive port
 infrastructure would improve quality of life.
