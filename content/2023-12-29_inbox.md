I've been trying to focus on developing a world view reading Smil this last month. There's lots that one could develop a
world view on. Particularly, in AI, I'm also trying to do the same.

I read some of my notes, from what must have been three years ago. I was literally trying to think about the asymptote
of growth from reading 'Growth' by Smil, then, as I am now. I've produced nothing in the interim.

For Energy, it feels we need a concrete sense of the barriers rather than purely theoretical.
- Why can we not have a human powered society, what are the exact numbers?

I see myself in the electronics space somehow. To manifest myself physically somehow.
