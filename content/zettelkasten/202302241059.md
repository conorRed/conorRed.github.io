* Region 3, just pitch control, no torque control (region 2).
* Trying to split up control systems for each.
* Control is quadratic function in region 2.
* Won't have to design a controller, but understand how it works.
* Torque control and pitch control (PID controller).
* Pitch control: Limit power production past rated wind speed.

## Wind farm control

* Turbines can be in wake of one another.
* You've reduced wind speed and power poduction for downstream turbines.
