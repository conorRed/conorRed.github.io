# Looking at energy
@energy

* Back in August I stated that the rise in energy costs in Ireland were due to the rise in wholesale gas prices. How
  does that look now?

## Context

* In 2021, natural gas was used to generate ~30% of irish electricity.
* We had a large amount of indigenous gas production from the Corrib gas fields since 2016, at about 50% of electricity
  generation. But this is all being scaled down and the hope is to replace it with renewables rather than imported gas.
* Prior to 2015 Ireland's import dependency (percentage of generation due to imports, assuming) was 90%. In 2021 it was
  80% so it's climbing back up. https://www.seai.ie/publications/Energy-in-Ireland-2022.pdf
* In 2021, gas was about 50% of our electricity generation (same source).

* Gas markets operate through contracts. The pricing mechanism varies, from what's called hub pricing, which is what
  seems to be regular supply/demand pricing and oil indexation which seems to lock in some sort of price (unsure on
  this).
* In the last couple years the first pricing has become more prominent.
* In Europe, 80% of gas is traded (in the form of contracts) at the Dutch trading hub.

* Ireland's electricity is around 27c/kwh https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-statistics/prices/
* It hasn't been below say 23c since before 2020. It's been gradually rising for the last decade.
* The price of gas is having a disproportionate affect on this but ultimately, how much it's moving the needle is
  questionable.
