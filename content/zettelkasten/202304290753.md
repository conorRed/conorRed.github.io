It's kind of crazy that moving electrons can create power. When you think about it all power is done this way, by
potential differences, seeking lower energy states. I've been meaning to try and think about fields and all that.

The stoics talk about the soul has being in a state of tension, that stoic sage's had the least amount of tension in
their soul and that was what was desirable. That intuitive notion of releasing tension is present in how we think about
fields too.

Louis rossman has a video about this where we basically torture electrons, they really just want to reduce their
potential but we guide them where we want them to go using this 'carrot' of potential. It's like arcing, the is such a
high potential that electrons eventually just jump the gap.
