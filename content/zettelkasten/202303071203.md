* How common is an inductive load, or, it doesnt really matter, if one exists at all you've to do this reactive power
  balancing act?
* Why do we need 3 phase power?

## Why do we need 3 phase power

* We see that for single phase instantaneous AC power we've $p = VIcos(1 + cos2\omegat)$. There's a constant aspect and
  then an oscillating component to the power.
* This second term can reverse, so it represents reactive power.
* This translates into uneven torque.
* Three phase delivers a more steady power.


## Why circuits draw more current when the load increases

* Impedance is dependent on frequency, as a load is addded to the shaft the impedance also decreases.
* If you're trying to maintain voltage, with an increase in required output power, the current must increase.

* In a wye connected circuit you've a 'phase' voltage and a 'line' voltage.
* Phase is across a winding. Line is across phases or windings.
* When you're measuring line voltages you're adding phasors.
* A motor is a balanced load. If you put a neutral in it, it would carry no current.
