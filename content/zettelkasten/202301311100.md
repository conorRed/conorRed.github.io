* In AC, power is delivered with frequency (2$\omega$).
* Frequency of AC. At a high frequency, the finite amount of time to charge a capacitor might be too high so it
  essentially allows current through it. Then, for lower frequencies, it has time to charge and discharge.
* Impedance is a complex number (so that it can keep track of phase difference?)
* Capacitor will let through high frequencies, inductors will stop high frequencies.
* Some more dmcc working through problems he's already done out.
