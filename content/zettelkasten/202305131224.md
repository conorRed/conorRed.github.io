## Where Deutsch improves on Popper

From listening to Bret Hall, it seems that the takeoff point for Deutsch vs Popper is the notion that,  not only does
conjecture have to be testable, but it also _must_ have an explanation. He uses the notion of a conjurers trick. Just
knowing that the person being sawed in half is actually not sawed in half is not enough. That the scientific method
involves an explanation as well as a testable hypothesis. The testable hypothesis here being that the person is cut in
half.
