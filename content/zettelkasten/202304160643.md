There's definitely a pattern for me of being disgruntled with my routine etc. I think it harkens back to a week I had
before where you just need to execute, like that ice skater, it's voluntary, I can think about how I feel at retros.

It's fairly obvious the things that don't have an aim I would think. None of the things I'm 'forcing' myself to do
aren't helping me in some way I don't think.

I know it's tempting but its important to not look at not doing meditation, or making an impulse decision as a failure.
As Aurelius says, all we have is the now and also it's just the antithesis of what mindfulness is about I feel. It also
gamifies things.
