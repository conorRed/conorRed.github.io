* Try to understand what Igor is on about.
* Variable frequency drives
* Attempt to understand the equivalent circuit.

* Ok, so I think slip speed is intuitive enough. You need a constant change in flux so that torque is constantly being
 generated.
* What are the leakages? Like flux and inductance?
* Just bonking today.
