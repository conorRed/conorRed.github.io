Nigel going off script, talking about boats.
 - "When will we have electric engine boats?"

## Boost Converter (step up)

* Duty cycle is fraction of time signal active. As opposed to duty ratio?
* When switch closed, current increases linearly. Diode is in reverse bias. Output capacitor supplying current to load.
* When switch open, diode is forward biased by inductor current. Charges the output capacitor.
* Fairly flew through those slides.
* I assume that you have very low inductance, surely this can dangerous because you can build up a large voltage.
* Boost usually operated in dcm.
* Just have to learn design equations off apparently.
* Right, now Nigel's just reading out the tutorial questions.
