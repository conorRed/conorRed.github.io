## Phasors

* Maths that we need to describe AC circuits. 
* Kirchoff's laws don't really apply, addition must be done with vectors.
* $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}; \omegat = 2\pi\frac{t}{T}$
    *  So $\omegat$ represents a fraction of the voltage oscillation at a given time.
* Linear system: applied volatge, get current of the same frequency.
* Reactive load: some energy being given to field, not necessarily all to the load. Non zero phase difference between
  voltage and current.
* Phase shift/Epsilon, or whats leading, is the impedance of the circuit.
* Exponential representation makes it easier for addition, subtraction, multiplication and differentiation. Easier to
  use mathematically.
* Create imaginary axis for notation etc. then take the real part when it's needed.
    * $v(t) = \text{Real} [V_0e^{j(\omegat}]$ the real part
* Converting rectangular to polar requires knowing what quadrant the vector is in.
* Walking through basic trigonometry, like wtf dmc.
* Imaginary axis seems to be handy for vector operations of power supplies.
