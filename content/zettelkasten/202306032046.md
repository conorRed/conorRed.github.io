In Domain Driven Design, Evans talks about the ingredients for effective modelling.

* Binding the model and implem
* Cultivating a language based on the model. Interacting with people who had no idea of class diagrams while he had no
    idea about their area slowly they learned how to express themselves in their 'joint' area consistent with the
    structure of the model. Understood without translation.
* The model had behaviour, enforced rules, it became _knowledge rich_ in that it started to embed knowledge into it.

> It is the creativity of brainstorming and massive experimentation, leveraged through a model-based language and
disciplined by the feedback loop through implementation, that makes it possible to find a knowledge-rich model and
distill it.
