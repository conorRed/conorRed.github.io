Georg Simmel writes:

> The degeneration of a difference in convictions into hatred and fight occurs only when there were essential, original
similarities between the parties. The 'respect for the enemy' is usually absent where the hostility has arisen on the
basis of previous solidarity. And where enough similarities continue to make confusions and blurred outlines possible,
points of difference need an emphasis not justified by the issue but only by that _danger of confusion_. This was
involved for instance in the case of Catholicism... Roman Catholicism does not have to fear any threat to its identity
from the external contact with a church so different as the Reformed Church, but quite from something as closely akin as
Old-Catholicism
