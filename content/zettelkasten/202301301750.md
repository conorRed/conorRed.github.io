From last weeks review. 

* Back in August I stated that the rise in energy costs in Ireland were due to the rise in wholesale gas prices. How
  does that look now?
* The general conclusion was that gas prices aren't really why we have high gas prices. It's at 27c now, but hasn't been
  below 23c since 
* Electricity prices have changed by 10% last year (up to June) according to SEAI.
* Residential gas prices went up 36% across all consumption profiles.
* With business gas prices going up by 100%.
* So I'd say my conclusions from last week weren't entirely accurate. Maybe it's just that the increase in gas prices is
  not so much seen in electricity bills.
* [General review, talking about how the supports of the government helped. Business increases here are nuts!](https://www.seai.ie/blog/stat-chat-irelands-energy/index.xml)

## Climate Action Plan 2022

## Buildings

* Generally, looking to see if there is any progress on the national retrofit plan, creating demand etc.
* wow
* > All buildings will need to switch to heat pumps or district heating by 2050, meaning that the gas grid will no
  longer supply existing homes and commercial premises.
* There's now retrofitting tax incentives for landlords, based on applying for the SEAI grant, which seems promising.
