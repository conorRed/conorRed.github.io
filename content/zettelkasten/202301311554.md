## Characteristics of the wind 

* Turbulence caused by dissipation of wind's ke into te via creation and destruction of smaller eddies.
* TI = \sigma/U where U is the mean wind speed. 
* Wind speed variation is considered normal.
* Average TI is about 10-20%.
* PDF gives us the pprobability of the wind speed taking on certain values.
* PDF is step up from turbulence intensity. P of u normally distbuted is pretty crude.
* If you work out average velocity you can work out average power.
* k = 2 implies a Releigh? distribution.
* Uses a gamma function?
* Lot of whiteboard work on Weibull distribution. Good for back of envelope calculation for propspecting a site.
* covariance scale up variablity of one variable with that of another.
