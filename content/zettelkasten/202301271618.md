* Review lecture on induction motor

---

* If we just focus with the normal vector (that is, palm in direction of current, bend fingers) trying to align itself
  with any external field, that should give an indicator of rotation.
* Rotor sits inside strator (caging) on ball bearings, with an air gap between the two of about 0.5 to 2mm.
* Superposition of magnetic field lines? 
* So that in a rotating magnetic field, intermediate magnetic fields can exist.
* Stick a magnet in the middle and it will want to 'follow' this rotating field.
* Synchronous motor: magnet uses DC current
* Induction motor, rotating magnetic field induces current??
* I can't really understand it too well from the lecture.
* The coils are confusing me, the aggregation of magnetic field lines.
