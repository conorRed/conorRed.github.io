* Variation in cultivation can com e from effective yield, fertiliser use.
* Different crops may require more or less fertiliser depeding on the environment.
* Optimized fuels, if manure was just going to be released into the atmosphere, in methane manure, optimized, yyou've
  converted it to 'usable' co2 emission. This could be a reason why it's a carbon 'sink ' in the analysis.
* Biggest environmental impact is 'cultivation' step. There's a lot of by products (from smog and burning).
* Agricultural practices is probably the biggest thing to address.
