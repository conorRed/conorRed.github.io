## Linguistics

I'm thinking of maybe starting to read through ckrisch book on selfie to start learning more about languages and
compilers and that. Ultimately, learning more fundamental computer science. Along with this, I'd like to engage more
with the notion of language and how it describes the world for us and that. The kind of GEB sense.

Doing this along with the standford encyclopedia on computation maybe. 

I'm tentative to start, because I've kind of tried before and failed, I guess I'll never know unless I try. But it's
annoying to think I could have tried to know all this stuff in my early 20's. At the same time, it wasn't like I was
doing nothing.
