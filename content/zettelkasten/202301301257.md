Time to have the lecture slides read out to us.

I forgot he records these, shouldn't have bothered coming

## Buck Converter

* For the buck converter, output voltage is always smaller than input voltage.
* In the on state, kind of charging up the inductor.
* Why do we need a capacitor and an inductor?
* Goal is to increase current but drop voltage.
* So when the switch is closed capacitor puts voltage across the opposite way which results in back emf from inductor.
* So it's always on really. Or what are it's modes of operation.
* Jesus Nigel.
* It's fucking absurd to have to pay for this.
* How are SMPS used in the real world?
