There's uncertainty involved in causal inference, think that's one reason to get better or becoming familiar with
modelling this uncertainty (statistics and probability).

Also, when probability goes into the realm of more continuous numbers, it's probably more accurate to associate it with
trying to quantify uncertainty, than an particular set of possible worlds.
