Need to get reference that KSR talks about on Ezra Klein podcast about not letting technology use us, or having a more
conscious relationship with our tools.


Also how widely adopted is chaos theory, mandelbrot sets and that? It seems a case of spontaneous generation to me.
Maybe I should read Gleicks book.


Also, want to push forward on phil science stuff, not too interested in the realist/anti-realist debate, might try and
get through rest of recommendations from five books.
