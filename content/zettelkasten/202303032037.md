Feeling good at the moment about probability. I really feel Tsitsiklis' book and course is good. I feel slightly more
empowered with the Math. Its simple and pedagogical.
I also feel it's a really useful thing to learn and can help things (like prediction markets).


I need to start actually applying it to something. Maybe trying to understand like Black Swan paper or something.
My goal for the week might be to get through this ocw course.

I currently have the feeling, which hits me actually often, is that I'm happy I'm alive and scared of death funnily
enough. I'm afraid I'll die right now and miss out on so many things I could learn and see. I look at this as a good
thing by the way!
