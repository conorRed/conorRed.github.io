## Feedstocks

* Just changing the orientation of the way glucose are connected to eachother can make things like cellulose and then
  things like starch (which we can break down).
* Hydrolysis (cutting water).
* Cellulose is resistant to this.
* Lignin, no defined structure but dominated by aromatic groups.

## Hydrothermal Processing

* Various compounds we want to break down. Put in a vessel that sealed, with water. Increase the temp. above 100 degrees
  creating a large amount of pressure.
* Originated from mineralogy.
* Increasing pressure on ice will make it liquid water. Rather than a more compact solid (phase diagram).
* Dotted lines are how quickly volume will increase if you fill something up to he labelled percentage. Isochoric.

I'm hoping to get more clarification on why the documents provided were considered 'insufficient'.

After my initial documentation submission I was requested to provide further documentation on previous independent living
situation. Despite this it was still considered insufficient, I'd like to know what I was missing or why what I provided was not enough.

I was unable to make time due to having exams all through January and was away from my house (where letter was received)
for Christmas.
