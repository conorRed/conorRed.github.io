## Religion in the Pew

* "Historians work with texts; how can we know the thoughts of those who did not write?"
* Todd opens up her book with historiography that goes over my head but still circles around a point of interest. How to
  determine what the common person believed or thought.
* Rituals is proposed as a good metric in that large gatherings of people with buy in were needed along with time
  (opportunity costs).
* Todd then describes how in reformed Scotland they had sessions for parishes where pretty much anything that happened
  would be adjudicated like a marriage or something unlawful etc.
* It gives a document of the common man for Scotland at the time in some sense as it was most likely close to issues
  concerning the whole parish.
