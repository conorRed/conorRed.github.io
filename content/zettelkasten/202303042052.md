# Singer

Over the past couple of days, in thinking about ethics Singer's argument of the 'Rescue Problem' is fairly shocking. You
don't have to do anything, but if you don't do anything you must accept you're a morally bad person.

You're really left with no option but to do something if you want to be moral. 

How do you operate in a world like this though. Where everyone around you (if you go down this 'moral' path) is immoral?
