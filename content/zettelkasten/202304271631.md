[Adam Tooze on what the Polycrisis is](Adam Tooze on what the Polycrisis is)

He discusses the perspectives that each of us have. In his apartment in NY when the lockdown happened, with all the WiFi
he could ask for etc. and that of  his cleaner who had shit wifi and 4 kids trying to get access to online education and
this is all in the same few blocks.

* He argues that a way to make sense of all that's happening around us is. If you amplify those differences, that even
  in Dublin are stark, to the world. We each view the world from a _highly specific_ vantage point withing this structure
  of inequality.
* "It's important to constantly question what we think of as mainstream, what we think of as relevant, what we think of
  as the central narrative of the moment and to check that against, as it were, other realities. Also, to try and
  compose the regional logics that make sense". A way of counterbalancing the way our minds in the west slide away from
  the global reality.
* The purpose of the concept is to make the confusion tangible.

In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qFCsoJ4IVY&t=3268shis) talk, Tooze discusses how public balance sheets of the
global north will need to de risk developing countries for private investment. This, in tandem with development of those
emerging economies so that they can generate tax revenue to pay back those debts and grow.
