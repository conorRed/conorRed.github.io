* Drawing out phases on the board for example problem.
* Trying to engineer a situation where the current is in phase with the voltage (for maximum power).
* As frequency increases inductor offers more resistance.
* A very reactive circuit, it can bee hard to get the power to 'go where you want it to' as it might be returned to
  source based on timing.
* Load (takes in charge particles and reduces their energy). Source increases charge energy. Look at current in and out
  to determine difference.
