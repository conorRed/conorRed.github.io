* Aim to get some key blocks of knowledge to point to for how induction works.

* The central principle is _faraday's law_.
* Tells us that a time varying electric field can act as a source of electric field.
* The current as a result of this is called the _induced current_.
* Through experimentation with a coil of wire (connected to a galvanometer) that is set between a variable magnetic
  field. A pattern, identified by Faraday seems to appear. That the magnetic flux is what matters, but more
  specifically, the time _changing_ flux.
* Induced emf is the negative of the time rate of change of magnetic flux through _a_ loop.
