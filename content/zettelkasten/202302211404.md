* Sub stations go from about 11kV to 30kV, about 9 around tcd.
* One interconnector to UK from Ireland (about 500 MW).
    * You build up capacitance between core and shield. This capacitance has to be charged and discharged.
    * If you transferred current with AC, you'd have to apply more current to overcome this constant discharging and
      charge. So DC is used.
