@daily @thought @computation 

I've been listening to Lattner on @lex. He's discussing types and the differences between programming languages etc.
Types model sets in a way. Software aims to model reality and I think its always hard to see that. Its similar to how
mathematics doesn't seem to have really any connection to the real world propositions and the like, but I wrote about
before with @wolfram on Lex that Aristotle picked out these logical connections etc. Austin Vernons blog post on
software, is it really productive has got me thinking about this core goal of software, to emulate reality, but the
fidelity at which it does this is key.

The notion that representations are substrate independent is interesting but I've yet to really make the jump to
substrate independence for computation. I can't really visualise the _physicality_ of computation.
