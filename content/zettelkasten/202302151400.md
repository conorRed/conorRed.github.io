@PD @lecture @biofuels

* Last lecture with Dunne.
* Oxygen evolved at one electrode to 'provide' electrons for hydrogen evolution reaction.
* Catalysts are platinum based so very expensive.
* Reaction happens at active sites on catalyst. Want more surface area. 
* Supports might be used to help with some portion of the reaction.
* I feel like a 50 min YouTube video, you would expect to get a lot of information out of, yet I sit in 50 min classes
  most days and seem to get little if anything out of them.
* For sorption storage methods, need low temperatures because any slight temperature and hydrogen would just dissociate
  from surface. 
* There also has to be a 'want' to understand. Maybe that doesn't always coincide with the lecture I suppose.
* Also, I'm hungry/hangry.
