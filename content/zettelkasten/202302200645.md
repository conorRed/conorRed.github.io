# Model of transformer

## Ideal Transformer

* Zero windings resistance.
* Infinite permeability.
* No flux leakage.
* No core losses.

H is referring to magnetic field strength.
B is referring to flux density.

The flux in the core of the transformer is net of $N_1I_1 - N_2I_2$ which is set equal to zero in an ideal transformer
but set equal to $N_1I_1 - N_2I_2 = R_c\phi_c$ the reluctance of propagation of the flux in the core.

Rotor circuit impedance is affected by speed.


Induction motor draws more current as you increase load? Same with transformer
