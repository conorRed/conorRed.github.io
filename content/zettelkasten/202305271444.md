Sometimes I'm paralysed by choice because what I actually want to do feels socially unacceptable. It's a balance of
course but sometimes I do just want to read for the whole day and kind of 'force' myself to do it just because it makes
my life easier. Who am I trying to justify myself too? Why does it bother me so? Similar to thinkings on the Ted Chiang
story.
