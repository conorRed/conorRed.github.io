* My general prior is that the power system we're looking at is distributing electrical energy.
* There are components involved in this distribution and I'm hoping to figure out the logic of why some of them exists.
* But also categorise them in a way.

* Generally, a motor is some energy conversion to mechanical energy.
* "Electricity is the best way to transport energy."
* Transfer of power is a function of current and voltage.
* Electricity plays this major role in long distance transferring of energy. So, for instance, heat used from combustion
  in some place can be used to power a blender or appliance miles away.
