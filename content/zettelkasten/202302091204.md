* For example 4.1. v rms is 100<0. 
* I_R = 10<0
* I_L = 26.93A<90
* More current going through inductor. I = R_R + I_L = 10 -j26.93.
* Current flowing is 28A, that gives 10A to resistor another value to inductor, but based on rms..
* P = 1000W.
* Reactive power is 2.6. Power factor is 0.35.
* Reactive compensation, adding a capacitor so that inductor power (which has some sort of feedback power effect) can be
  allowed for.
* Not always obvious whats the load and the source.
* 4.2: S = -500(P) + 8666j(Q). In this case the negative power is dumping power into source, but providing reactive
  power. Example might be inertia of motor, shut off producing a back emf.
* 4.3. d) S = 2.9MVA, V = 10.02KV.  e) 
* His teaching style is painful.
