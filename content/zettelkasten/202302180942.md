On train here, might fall asleep.

* My thinking has slightly changed for the AC motor. There's not actual current put through the rotor, it's just a
  squirely cage, so this would need to be hooked up to something else to generate power?
* How can you use an AC motor to generate the three phase electricity supply. Even if you mechanically turn the rotor.
  Oh, I think this is where the slip speed is greater than the magnetic field. In this instance, the rotating magnetic
  field will try and pull the rotor magnetic moments back. How does this translate the mechanical to electrical energy?

## Generation of Electric Power

* Back to square one, how does this happen with an AC motor?
* You rotate (mechanically) the rotor faster,
* It seems to me that in order to generate the rotating magnetic field you already need the AC voltage. Seems like a
  chicken and egg situation.
* How do you start a motor?
* Think it's important to get a notion of power in the air gap?
* I think it might lie in relating power to torque.

#### Induction Generator

* The rotor in a generator is salient pole or cylindrical.A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_(electric).

## How is the current induced in the rotor related to slip frequency?

* _Slip frequency_ is the frequency of the relative speed of the synchronous magnetic field in the rotor frame of
  reference.
* FUCCKKCKK. Why can't I understand this!
* Is the torque oscillating?
