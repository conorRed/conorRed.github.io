Some things on my mind this morning

* Dimensional analysis: maybe important not to over hype this but i found it useful this morning to get a handle on defining functions for a
  problem. Like in wind energy. That you can kind of break down relationships of variables, I think.
* Solar flares: what do we know about them?
* Olivine as storing water from solar magnetic field, heard on a podcast that the ejection of hydrogen from the sun
  could be stored in silicate minerals despite high temperatures in the early earth.
* Macro financial frameworks for the green transition, daniella gabor work. Thinking this is where important ideas are
  happening.
* Need to read How Asia Works to really get a good case study of the different market aspects that work.
