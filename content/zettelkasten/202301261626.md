* Aim to understand inductor as an electronic component.

* Lenz's law (direction of induced current in a loop): the magnetic field due to
  the (induced) current has a magnetic field that opposes the changing magnetic
  flux.
* Regardless of how electrical energy is induced in a loop, energy is always
  transferred to thermal energy because of resistance in the loop.
