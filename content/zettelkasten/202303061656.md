# What am I thinking in the Energy space at the moment?

* I'm thinking about models.
* How much credence should be given to hypothesis like that of Alex Epstein.
    * More generally, why is climate change not an existential risk?
        * My initial thinking is that outcomes could be non linear. Like the feedback warming affect in the oceans. This
          creates unpredictability, but how much?
        * It might be helpful too to get a sense of Epstein's argument.
* What's my mental model for climate change? It's causes, how we measure it, arguments etc.?

          
## Uncertainty

The AR5 will rely on two metrics for communicating the degree of certainty in key findings:

* Confidence in the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of **evidence (e.g.,
  mechanistic understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgment)** and the degree of agreement. Confidence is
  expressed **qualitatively**.
* Quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding expressed probabilistically (based on statistical analysis of
  observations or model results, or expert judgment).

---

* It is noted in AR5 that models determine certainty, while it hasn't changed largely, it's still a factor.
