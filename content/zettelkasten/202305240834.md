## Randomness

On the Lex podcast Knuth talks about the efficiency that randomness can have in algorithms. He describes how he went
about looking into the bible, rather than base it on what others told him or reading through the whole thing which
probably couldn't be grasped he figured the best way to figure it out was to choose 60 or so random passages and study
what people had written about them intensely.
