* Apparently we get our coal, for electricity generation, once a week to Limerick, from Texas.
* Concentrated Solar Power, under cloud cover, store energy in panels?
* The cylindrical shaft is the prime mover.
* We're going through stators and rotors, yet we assumed it in IS class.
* Frequency of electric energy
* Inertia, using frequency o associated mechanical and electrical energy. Torque is related to angular velocity which is
  related to frequency.
* Ex 5.1: f = 51.34Hz.
* Rotating current loop has max speed with zero flux. 
* Emf is 90 degrees out of phase with the actual flux.
* Is this the first time he's seeing these slides or explaining this stuff?
* Confused about where the 120 has come from. Revolutions per minute to hertz. Frequency in radians per second
  multiplied by 60.
* Ex 5.2: 18 pole pairs.
