I've struggled in the last couple days with just keeping un wanted thoughts out of my head. Just in terms of it feels
the frequency of just ignoring thoughts has gone up.

I also feel that this can emerge as exaggerating things like if I eat a slice of toast I'm worried about carbs etc.

Just not feeling great the last few days to be honest.
