* I've been reading the 'making of the atomic bomb'. Oppenheimer is the most fascinating of the bunch for me so far,
  along with Bohr. Their philosophical viewpoints are interesting. Rhodes highlights the role that technology and
  science played in war. I think this is a very important point in the growth of physics as we know it in the early 20th
  century. Science in general has this implication of immediate utility sometimes. I dunno.
* It's fascinating how there were so many discoveries in such a period of time and rutherford got about half of them!
* Pretty interesting video on the role women played in early cataloguing of stars. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2k_LcdH960
