* Belief systems and peoples rationality in them. Listening to the skeptics guide podcast, they talked about a new
  Darthmouth study that looked at how people can act rational in their belief systems. In this case, referring to faulty
  voting. The idea being that to have discourse, we need to understand peoples priors. 
* Having action when learning something seems vital, electronics is a classic example, just do, whatever you need to
  know, pick up along the way. It's not really totally general a learning approach but just an observation.
* The scientific method would tell you, it's not about what you want to be the case but what is the case. This seems
  applicable to economics and general financial climates. You might dispute the way actors in our economic system act
  but it's crucial to be aware that they do act this way. It's like how Studwell talks about good industrial policy
  being conscious of this and redirecting it towards the countries developmental needs.
