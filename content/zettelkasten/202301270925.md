# Development not population drives global CO2 emissions.


* The population of low income countries could increase by billions and it would barely nudge global CO2 emissions.

* "We could add 5 billion people to low income countries, and the increase in global CO2 emissions would be less than
  the drop in emissions in 2020 due to Covid-19"!!
* Low income countries are accounting for 9% of the global population.
* Bumping up the low income group to lower-middle income would increase emissions output from 37 to 38 billion tonnes. 
* "If we keep adding billions this rises to 39.3, then 41.3, then 43 billion tonnes."
* The change in CO2 emissions is small but the gain in standard of living is great.
* My head is about to explode from caffeine.
