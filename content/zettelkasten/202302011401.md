Materials with more lignocellusoic biomass. Some methods were hydrothermal treatment.

Christ, not in the mood for Dunne's bullshit.

* For 2nd generation crops, more looking at pyrolysis and gasification.
* Biomass is ground to increase the surface area.
* The major use of syngas is the production of hydrogen.
* Syngas is steam reforming of methane.
* Water gas shift reaction, a way of reacting carbon monoxide with water to get CO2 and hydrogen. Exothermic, needs
  lower temperatures.
* I'm very fidgetty today.
