It occurred to me, on my walk, that I'm often frustrated with how little I know, or can remember. There's a
dissatisfaction with not knowing, that I should know more as opposed to acceptance of who I am in a knowledge space
sense. No more unique (worse off or better off) than the majority of the population. The practical response is curiosity
and enthusiasm thats in there somewhere.

I've been thinking too about my statements on things. For example, I made a statement that my Spanish housemates are
probably rich because of redistribution of land after the Civil War. It's a strong claim that I literally have no
evidence is true. I'm ashamed of myself when I make these claims but as Einstein says, we must all sacrifice at the
alter of stupidity.
