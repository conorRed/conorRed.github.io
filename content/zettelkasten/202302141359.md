* There's a triangular waveform that moderates the sinusoidal wave. This control circuit generates the triangular and
  sinusoidal voltages. 
* Sometimes it's annoying when lecturers think they're asking coherent questions, when they're not.
* Explanation of diodes as safety measures, not too sure how. There is a risk at 'infinite' potential at A without them.
