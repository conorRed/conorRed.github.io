This morning I sacked off the coffee morning with SpaceSoc. I just don't know if I can really be social in it. Not
having a great morning, just not a great jiu-jitsu session and then this.

# Probability
@probability

Trying to look at probability. My goal at the moment is to work through the first 4 chapters of Jaynes. Mainly, defining
the sample space, so getting use to the delineations. And then, just getting used to the idea that multiplication
implies conditionals.

I'm also conscious that I need a project to apply it all to. Without this is hard to have that progressive overload
that's needed.

Think MIT opencourseware could also be a good resource.

## Superconductivity

* Listened to Bragg on this, still don't understand it, seems interesting though.
* Same with recent dark matter, black hole stuff, need to spend a bit of time looking at it.

# Non sleep deep rest

Might start incorporating this, daily, see if it helps. Huberman's got a 10 min one.
