Entropy may develop through the idea that at decision points in a system, the least work choice tends towards disorder
of the system. For instance, when I use a stick note or notepad or pen, the least work is to just place it anywhere on
my desk rather than put it back in my drawer. The accumulation could result in broadly a disordered desk. Although
accumulation might not be this deterministic.
