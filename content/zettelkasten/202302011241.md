## Design equations for Buck converter

* Ripple is the periodic variation of a DC voltage within a power supply that has been derived from alternating current.
* The value of the capacitor is obtained from the voltage ripple condition.
* Can think of power of the inductor, or energy transferred to it's magnetic field. 

Some more work done out on paper, ultimately not very comfortable with how to derive the design equations.
