## Control Engineering

* Pitch control.
    * Changing angle of attack of wind.
* Torque control.
* 46/47% efficiency very high for wind turbine.
* Excess energy at high wind speed needs to be disposed of.
* Stall control. Wind speed above a certain speed starts to create turbulence on trailing edge of blade.
* Most control systems are based on feedback.
* Open loop control doesn't have monitored output. Example would be microwave, which heats for specified time rather
  than some predefined goal of heated contents.
* Control inpu tis directly related to error between output and desired output.
