Getting tactility to our possible futures.

The future energy lab


---

* Today was not a good day. Lot of anxiety and verging on spiralling into what, I don't know. Can be kind of scary
  sometimes. Distracting myself with interesting things helps but at the moment I've to study non interesting things.
* Just a bad day I suppose, good to practice dealing with it, that's the approach I tried to take anyways, wasn't
  perfect but did something.
* I think it didn't help that I pushed myself hard last week, while not getting much sleep. I think it can kind of
  accumulate.
* I feel so delicate sometimes. I have a tendency to self sabotage also. 
* Life's not easy I suppose, everyone struggles, I shouldn't be ashamed by it.
* I should have stayed home for another night. I just get this ball of anxiety and need to distract myself from it. 
* I think maybe reminding myself of what I'm thankful for and trying to bring myself back to earth. Easier said than
  done.
* I'm also looking for some form of penance or something. Especially with food, I feel if I fuck up and eat the wrong
  thing, or too much, I've to 'pay' for it somehow, even when it's not even worth dwelling on. To be honest, the less I
  dwelt on it probably the better.
