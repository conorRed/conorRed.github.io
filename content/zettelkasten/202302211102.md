Looking at real life transformers I think

* Hysteresis loss is due to aligning 'spin' of electrons in material, which has an associated friction
  (non-conservative).
* It's really hard to follow along here.
* Open circuit test, leave one side open. Apply voltage across lower side. 
* Susceptance (or admitance?) used because you'd have to add impedances in parallel otherwise. Ex 9.2.
    * $Y_m = 0.0062 \text{siemens}$.
