* Try and walkthrough graphical method of rotating magnetic field.

## B-H relation

* Depending on the material, the flux can be different from the field strength. In ferromagnetic materials (with a net
  magnetism), the flux would be different as the superposition's of the fields change the initial field strength value in
  an area of the material.
* $\phi = \muB$ where $\mu$ is dependent on the material (this is unity in free space).

## Magnetomotive force (mmf)

* Defined as $Ni$ and in units of ampere-turn.
* Intuitavely I see it as the force withing coil (so not really including leakage/ parts of the field that cancel out).
* We use this to determine the superposition of magnetic force in the rotating magnetic field.
* How do we determine the direction of mmf?
* Assuming all flux is confined to the core. A ferromagnetic core amplifies the field lines.
* In the example it's perpendicular to the axis of the magnet, maybe it's talking about force of a charge?

## Rotating Magnetic Field Winding

* Wiring is set up so that rotating field is generated. So just take it as given (in terms of current directions) for
  now.
