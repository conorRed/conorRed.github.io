## Aerodynamics of Wind Turbines
 
* Think of rotor as circular disk capable of extracting energy from the wind.
* When the air mass passes through this disk, ke to electrical energy is 'attempted'.
* Stream tube is the area that is convertible to electrical energy.
* Need mass flow rate to be constant throughout stream tube. This means the air in is the same as the air out. In order
  to satisfy some sort of equilibrium equation.
* Focus on a uniform wind speed profile.
* Some of the rotor energy could be returned to the air (as turbulence).
* He's writing very small on the board.
* 

It can be very draining when the lecture becomes too challenging to engage with. Like Igor's stuff.
Not the most inspired lecture here.
