## IGBT

* Power switching transistor. Used in inverters and inverters.
* When device is used as a switch, similar to bipolar transistor. Presence of gate makes it much easier to drive?

Next two lectures trying to show these components in full power train (finally).

### Lecture 9

* It's interesting to look at the connection costs for PV. Does the module decrease not create the majority of this
  reduction? Not anything we're looking at.

Definitely one of the most useless lecturers I've ever had.
