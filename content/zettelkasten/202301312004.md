[Home Streching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fT64OQiwVg)

* States there's no great evidence for static stretching.
* 1 min stretch per muscle group. Kind of just increasing the elasticity and not letting it return to its tightened
  shape. Creep deformation.
* Passive and active range. Active range, trying to put foot to head (without pressure). 
* Hip external rotation:
    * Stretch: Knee outside foot across. 90 degree hip stretch.
    * Foot towards outer shoulder, rather than across midline.
    * Bringing shoulder and chest down towards foot.
    * Actively: put hand up and try and externally rotate to touch foot off hand.
* Hamstring:
    * Lie on back, leg up, use belt if needed (preferably hand on toes) and pull toward you.
    * In combination with hip flexor stretch, dropping down hips, leg out in front (front splits). Toes pointed.
