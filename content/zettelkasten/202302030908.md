* I listened to Philosophize this! podcast on Simone Weil. An example is used of making a habit of reading and how you
  can 'will' yourself to do it. Weil might argue that you should try and understand what it is you find difficult, to
  interact with and work with that. She says this is the class of the will and understanding of things, when more
  sensitivity is needed.
* It's interesting as an add on to the kind of Jocko mentality, where just doing stuff can take you far but may not
  offer a whole lot. 
* I'm skeptical of how novel I suppose weils approach is. After reading @tom-holland 'Dominion' it's hard to know what
  ideas are really philosophical and just derived from religion.
* This doesn't mean it's not interesting advice, but I just wonder how applicable it is. One of the main things with
  Simone Weil is how she really led by example and tried to practice what she preached. Definitely worth paying
  attention to her I think.

Having one of those evenings where I can do anything I want but nothing at all! Paradox of choice I suppose.
I put a large amount of emphasis on how I use my time, so when I feel im wasting it, it's draining. But in the end, I
suppose, doesn't really matter what I do.
