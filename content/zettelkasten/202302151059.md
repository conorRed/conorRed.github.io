* An airfoil, any shape designed to produce max. lift. Lift to drag ratio.
* For a streamlined bdy flow is atached for the most part.
* Need to increase weight and stiffness of blades, to reduce lift, have more drag force (which is what we derive power
  from?).
* Airfoil produced with bio mimicking, looking at birds.
* Coefficients of lift and drag, are a function of airfoil/angle of attack.
* NACA classification  is a way of classifying an airfoil, with certain dimensions that seem variable among airfoils.
* You can build up the shape of the airfoil from the NACA digits.
* For certain airfoils (cambered), there is lift even at zero angle of attack.
