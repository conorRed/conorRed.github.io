Thought I'd keep some form of log re: the arm.

Feeling fine today, I don't notice it when I'm still. It's probably more swollen now in the forearm and hand than it's
ever been. I'm hoping this is due to the more movement its getting. If it's not gone in a week or so then it's probably
a sign. I do have some discomfort during the day with it, like it's tired or something. Hopefully I'm not putting it
under too much strain. Tomorrow should be fairly relaxed anyways.

I've been watching a lot of TNG recently. There's probably not much to most of the episodes. I enjoy it though. A lot of
it is kind of just problems with the crew but it's engaging. Its a world Id like to live in to I suppose.
