## Daily checklist

* [ ] Think about career...again

## Notes

* [Outliers Malcom Gladwell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcMKLwVlpJk), poverty as a constraint no matter your IQ.
* Personal view about how the world works. Where humans are not inherently good, or, the notion of good we define. We're
  dictated by incentives and also biology that often deviates from some moral good that some of us define.
    * I feel more OK will having differing beliefs in that they're my perspective as opposed to being wrong
* "The experiences of the Soviet Union and China have shown that making a socialist revolution in a poor country is not feasible
  from the economic standpoint. The State is able to promote basic industrialization, but it is inefficient to allocate
  resources in complex economies"
* The dutch disease
