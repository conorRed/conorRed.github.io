# Blog post ideas

* Initially thought of doing learning ones like, how does combustion work or something
* I think actually answering questions might be a better route
* Something like, what is a 'universal computer' and how do we tie it to the real world or our experienced world
* Gives me a chance to look at logical propositions and how they fit in
* I'd like to do some evidence based stuff too, to use maybe some of the rationality learnings, whatever they may be.
* I think re hashing resources might not be useful.

### Science

* What is a universal computer?
* How do logical propositions construct our reality (similar to the russell paper)
* Is there some basic structure to programming languages, that all must have? Is what we define on a computer always an
  algorithm?
* Is the idea of information fundamental? 

### History

* Im not feeling inspiration for anything today. I'm going to take an hour of farting about
