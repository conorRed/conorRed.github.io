## Daily checklist

* [ ] Put my daily links and thoughts on website

## Notes

* Marc Andreesen rest is history podcast
    * :economics:
    * With "his economist hat on"
    * "Technology never leads to mass unemployment the reason is what technology represents is an increase in
      productivity in economic terms, technology is a way to do more with less when you do more with less you increase
      societal wealth, as you increase societal wealth you increase consumer demand you increase consumer spending power
      you literally create new demand, ability for people to be able to pay and afford things, new industries, new
      fields, new activities get created that end up soaking up all the labour"
* My evidence based beliefs on housing in Ireland are shockingly slim. I have beliefs in beliefs like:
    * :housing:
    * Developers are cronies
    * Height restrictions are stupid
    * Ireland is growing and cheap money is available to 'grow'... or something
* [Organic disaster](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/09/organic-disaster.html)
    * :economics:
    * "Organic farming has its place but it takes a lot of human capital to make it work and overall it results in lower
      yield and thus more land used."
    * We need energy innovation. Scaling back on what makes up the modern world is not feasible.
* [Artist has bank account shut down](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-activist-ai-weiwei-says-credit-suisse-closing-his-foundations-bank-2021-09-07/)
    * "Many major Western banks, including Credit Suisse, have made winning business from China's ever-growing ranks for the
      ultra-wealthy a central part of their strategies."
    * :China:
* Pinkers book on Rationality
    * "We achieve rationality by implementing rules for the community that make us collectively more rational than any
      of us are individually. People make up for one anotherâ€™s biases by being able to criticize them"
