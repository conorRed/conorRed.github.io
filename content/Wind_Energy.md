* manipulation of 'leading edge', called 'pitching'.
* Located higher from the ground where wind speeds are higher
* Turbine (electricity), mill (mechanical work).
* Lack of offshore wind, one of the reasons we lag behind Denmark (similar size, environment and population).
* Offshore turbines significantly bigger than onshore (94m blades).
* Power is a function of swept area and wind speed.

* The wind resource (how we can model it).
* Causes of wind: air pressure differences.
* Sun heats atmosphere differently around the globe.
* Differential heating and coriolis effect. This develops an atmospheric boundary layer due to friction with air and
  earth. This boundary layer has a 'vertical velocity profile'.
* "Wine engineering is best described as the rational treatment of interaction betweeen wind in the atmospheric boundary
  layer and man and his works on the surface of earth"
* off shore wind allows access to high windspeeds for low altitudes.
* reduction in velocity of wind is a function of surface roughness, different for different terrain types.
* Wind is stochastic. Wind speed can be assumed statistically as the sum of a mean component and a fluctuating
  component.
* If you go out and measure wind speeds over a 10 minute interval, generally fairly stable.
* Fluctuations in wind speed over that 10 minutes is called turbulence.
* A measure of turbulence is turbulence intensity. I or Iv. Std deviation of the windspeed/mean wind speed. A crude measure
  of turbulence. Normally varies from 5-30% average of about 10%.
* We can use the kinetic energy of the wind for _power_. To do useful work.
* From a power point of view you want large turbulence and windspeeds, but from a design point of view, the higher the
  windspeed, the higher the load (on the structure).
* Load due to wind ...
* Felxible wind structures, making it dynamic for dynamic loads.
* Dynamic loading (loading that changes with time).
* streamlined body (wing of airplane), when immersed in fluid flow doesn't have detachment from fluid. Compared to a bluff body (like a
  building).
* Bluff body aerodynamics slide.
* Components to a wind turbine.
* Blades rotate low speed shaft, at the same speed as the blade, gearbox steps up the low speed rotation to a high speed
  shaft, connected to a generator
* Vast majority of turbines are upwind machines (the blades are not shadowed by tower). The drawback being, the blades
  need to beoriented (yawing) to the wind, needs a yawing sysstem which can be expensive.
* Most of failures are due to gearbox failures.
