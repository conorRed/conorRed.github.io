When do I feel that I like software engineering?

- When I don't feel out of my depth.
- When I feel that software offers really nice solutions to problems.
- When the theoretical aspects are interesting to me.

### When do I feel out of my depth

There's a notion in psychology of 'flow'. This is a state where something is just challenging enough

The level of challenge of the activity plays a key role in reaching flow state.
If the challenge is too low relative to one's skill level, then one is likely to
become bored and unengaged. However, if the challenge greatly exceeds current
abilities, one can become overly frustrated. The flow state emerges most easily
at the balance point. Maintaining this balance of challenge level and capacities
requires continually upgrading challenges as your capacities and skills grow.

Some key elements believed to promote flow include:
- having clear proximal goals,
- receiving immediate feedback on progress.
- feeling a sense of personal control over the situation or activity.
- losing any sense of self-consciousness or self-imposed obstacles
- Feeling the experience to be intrinsically. I think this relates to [[directionality of value]] and the creative project.
