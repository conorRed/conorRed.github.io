    - [[Agnes Callard]]
    - Interesting article about ethics and aesthetics (what we find subjectively beautiful)
    - Our views on people can be shaped by their character (ethics) as much as by their aesthetics
      (whether we feel conceit for what they find beautiful)
        - "We pick our friends as much by the contents of their playlists as the contents of their
          characters"
    - Callard argues that we cant agree to disagree on aesthetics and that this can be an issue in a
      political and cultural sense. "An aesthetic divide between two human beings is not trivial; it
      obstructs their ethical relations."
    - A story where a difference in aesthetics took on an ethical dimension.
    - "The question here is the degree to which peoplesâ€™ inability to see eye-to-eye is itself
      something they can see eye-to-eye about."
