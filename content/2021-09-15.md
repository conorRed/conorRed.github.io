## Daily checklist

* [ ]

## Notes

* Maybe school was too easy on us, maybe we should have been taken more seriously as teenagers and taught a subject more
  rigorously
* Norm MacDonald Dostoevsky moth joke
* [Percentiles over averages](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-percentile-approximation-works-and-why-its-more-useful-than-averages/)
    * Averages can dramatically over represent outliers. This could deviate from the 'use case' of api response times (in
      this article).
    * This is the case in long tail distributions
    * Using averages and medians for percentiles allows you to see the impact for the percentile of users (for instance, 90%
      of users)
* [Housing inequality as a large factor in income inequality](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/)
    * Increase in land value or in economy of an area is siphoned by landowners as more income hikes housing
* [What is evidence?](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS)
    * > It is an event entangled, by links of cause and effect, with whatever you want to know about.
    * > here I’m just talking about “entanglement” in the sense of two things that end up in correlated states because
      of the links of cause and effect between them.
    * > Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence
    * In the eye example this would be that your brain circuitry after processes the image of your shoelace you are
      tangled up with the cause effect links about whether your shoelace is tied or untied.
    * The use of evidence is to support a belief.
