Title: Why Doesn't Software Show Up in Productivity?

Summary from Vernon [^2]:

> I think the idea is that the world's so complex and we really underestimate that complexity. If you're going to
digitize processes and automate them and stuff, you have to capture all that complexity basically at the bit level, and
that's extremely difficult. And then you also have diminishing returns where the easily automatable stuff goes first and
then it's increasing corner cases to get to the end, so you just have to go through more and more code basically. We
don't see runaway productivity growth from software because we're fighting all this increasing complexity.

Vernon starts out with this idea that computers are kind of considered a GPT[^1]. This liberalisation of information
processing and access. He argues that, in fact, computers are a technology of the more managerial shallow kind.


> Management techniques are a technology in a broad sense of the word. Assembly lines are one prominent example.
Management techniques are fiendishly difficult to adopt. Improvements in management manifest as differences in company
productivity that force most competitors to bankruptcy or merger, if competition allows.

> Because computers lack tacit knowledge, instructions must have bit-level detail. A supervisor can't walk up to a
computer, show it how to attach a fastener, then walk away. A program has to be written by a software engineer that
details every actuator movement in sub-millimeter detail.

Like this quote

> Software engineers improve the ability of software to absorb more of our complex world.
>

He uses the system thinking concept of bottlenecks which I'm not too familiar with. I think the example tries to
illustrate that in the real world you can have bottlenecks in the form of silos, a critical area of the company that is
enmeshed in many processes.

> No one creates software for processes that underly their [a companies] unique competitive advantages.

I don' really understand this thinking

>  Silos also tend to use pidgin languages and force employees in non-critical departments to learn them. Completing a
complicated form if you need parts from the brass works is an example. Generic software might not mix well with the
company's core processes. Because the software added to excess capacity, the only way to earn a return is by layoffs.
Companies are laying off workers that understand how to interface with their unique processes!


Software in the waterfall method was obviously a massive failure but through learnings from the Toyota production
system, things like lean where you produce smaller components that are non variables or that can be produced reliably as
well as iterating to use 'tacit knowledge'

> If you give an Agile software team requirements for the software you need, they automatically assume those
requirements are wrong. Instead of building what you ask, they take a small piece and hack together a prototype and then
get your feedback. Then they do it again and again. The team continuously improves the software based on your needs that
are difficult to communicate.

You don't get productivity growth until the company becomes a giant.

One of the examples used, if you're trying to 'simulate' or codify the real estate industry down to the ones and zeroes
its just too large to really even start working on with no idea of return on investment. Im unsure where the **nature of
the firm fits in here**


> Imagine the entire real estate industry (including agents, financiers, inspectors) all agreeing on standards that have
detail at the bit level. Now you know why we have iBuyers instead. Current software reduces the costs within firms more
than it reduces the cost of market transactions.

* Languge.
* Clothing.
* Money.
* Electricity.
* The wheel.
* Fire.
* Steam engine.

[^3]: Vertical integration is a strategy that allows a company to streamline its operations by taking direct ownership
of various stages of its production process rather than relying on external contractors or suppliers.
