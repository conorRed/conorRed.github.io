# Hard Step Model

* Carter (not sure where yet) posits that a sequence of steps each of which are acheived at some rate per unit time.
* The average time $t_i$ to complete a step $i$ is $a_i$. 
* 
* How does it imply a power law of time?

## Power Law

"A power law is a functional relationship between two quantities where a relative change in one quantity results in a
proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the size of the initial quantities"

If we have some observable thing A that's related to another observable thing B by a power law. If A increased by 50%,
then B would increase by x1.5 that is some constant times 50%.

How do I model A increasing as an exponential.


In a linear system, there is a constant relationship between A and B. It doesn't change through time.

What if the relationship was further characterised by what B became for a given A?
Fundamentally, the relationship is changing through time. 
The constant between the too is growing.
