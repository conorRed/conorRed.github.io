* From the public engagement process (p. 13) the key areas of concern from the public are outlined. With micro
  generation being highly favoured and promotion of technologies like offshore wind.
* Key takeaways from engagement (p.16)

## Irish Approach

In reference to "developing and enhancing our electricity infrastructure", through over 100 events in a 14 week
consultation process 4 possible approaches were discussed:
    * Generation led: Government policy would decide where generation should be, where the grid is strongest. This
      would likely mean more offshore wind off of the east coast where more power is demanded. Generally, allowing
      generation developments only in regions that have high demand.
    * Developer led: This is the current policy for Ireland's electric grid. Wherever someone wants to develop
      generation, its up to EirGrid to put them online. With this approach planned projects will be able to fill the 70%
      electricity requirement but existing infrastructure would not be able to expand in time to put that all on the
      grid. Lot's more projected (~70) would be needed and would not be completed by 2030 according to EirGrid
      estimates. It would also cost a lot more.
    * Tech led: This approach is an offshoot of the developer led approach. In both approaches expected renewable
      generation is to be 4GW. In the tech led approach the plan is to use HVDC cabling internally. This is complicated
      and will require almost as much funding as the previous approach. It's thought that this approach would might allow
      2030 targets to be hit. Although just in general, looking at different technologies to transport clean energy to
      different regions across the country.
    * Demand led: Government policy determines where large energy users locate on the power system to best avail of
      system resources and minimise cost. It's expected that by 2030 27% of electricity demand will be from data
      centers. Most of these centers are locating themselves on the East coast putting more strain on the grid there
      whereas most developments of generation are going to remote areas where the grid is weaker.

> EirGrid will take a Generation-led approach complemented by aspects of the Demand-led and Technology-led approaches.

There's a consistent emphasis on public engagement. That to involve communities is to give them skin in the game also
trying to build trust between EirGrid and the public.

## How the electricity grid is expected to change

* How and where the electricity is generated.
* How and where electricity is connected to the grid.
* How electricity is bought and sold.
* How electricity is used.

## Feedback driving decisions

From what I can tell, it's mainly public feedback being used to drive decisions.

> Rural communities stressed that they need to share in any economic upturn as a result of the implementation of plans
to achieve renewable energy targets. This includes, encouraging large energy users such as data centres to locate in
regional towns and cities, and balancing offshore and onshore generation to sustain jobs and investment

Community ownership of renewable projects stressed as useful way to get people to understand the importance of the
energy infrastructure. This would be followed by _microgeneration_ where these community led projects are connected to
the grid.

Appendix 2 contains lots more detail on the feedback responses.

## The Broad strokes road map

* Irelandâ€™s demand is expected to grow significantly in the period to 2030, primarily driven by the connections of Large
  Energy Users (LEU), and the electrification of heat and transport. LEUs are not anticipated to develop at a similar
  scale in Northern Ireland, although a modest amount of such demand may occur by 2030.

## The Roadmap has 4 basic areas:

* Network Infrastructure.
* Engagement.
* System Operations.
* Electricity Markets.

### Network Infrastructure

* 40 projects across south Ireland, 12 in the north.
* Expected generation of [^1]:
    * 5.1 GW offshore wind
    * 2.4 GW onshore wind
    * 600 MW micro generation (solar).
    * 1.3 GW of large scale solar.
    * 1.65 GW of battery storage.
    * 2.6 GW of derated (?) gas.
* The Greenlink, Celtic interconnector and a 2nd north south interconnector are all assumed for projections.
* Enablers for this infrastructure change are highlighted here also. Curious, specifically about " Deliver an
  electricity grid Technology Toolbox solution for enhanced network operation".

## Engagement

Comes about mainly due to the fact that it's expected there will be major infrastructure changes so need buy in from
people it will be placed near.

#### System Operation

Have to figure out a way to accommodate the various non-synchronous sources of power that will be coming online.

Seems mainly to be fluff here, don't think there's much said. Just emphasising a TSO-DSO partnership.

# Microgeneration

What affect would large scale micro generation have on the grid?

power system had experienced an all-time peak load of 6.78 GW which occurred in January 2021, and a maximum all-time
wind output of 4.47 GW1 which occurred in February 2021."
