# Stakeholder Analysis

## Identifying stakeholders

* When identifying affected stakeholders, a systematic approach often works well, starting with delineating the
  project’s geographic sphere of influence. Here, think not only about the primary project site(s), but also all related
  facilities, including associated facilities, transport routes, areas potentially affected by cumulative impacts, or
  unplanned but predictable developments. Use this analysis to establish and articulate your project’s area of influence
  and determine who might be affected and in what way.
* In terms, not all stakeholders have the same payoff matrix or incentives.
