# A review on biomass: importance, chemistry, classification, and conversion 

_Tursi_

* The timescale of the carbon cycle is reduced with biomass. Using biomass for fuel releases carbon into the atmosphere
  that just came from the atmosphere.
* This carbon is then absorbed again by other biomass and the cycle repeats.

## Biomass availability

* "Several reports estimate the world's total biomass land and aquatic reserves as around 1.8 trillion tons and 4 billion
  tons respectively".
* With a potential production capacity of 33, 000 EJ (80 times the annual energy utilisation of the world).
* In some countries biomass accounts for 50% of energy needs (14% around the world).

* Why do we want to "hydrolyze" cellulose?

Skipped to section 5.

* How to convert biomass to energy:
    * Thermo-chemical conversions: combustion, pyrolysis, gasification and liquefaction.
    * Combustion is about 90% of this category.
    * The average thermal energy produced is 20Mj/kg of biomass.
