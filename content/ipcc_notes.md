This 'emissions gap' is what we will emit, vs what we 'should' or have to emit for certain
scenarios.

NDC's?? National declared commitments?

There's also an *implementation gap* where projected global emissions implied by policies for 2030
are around, 50-60 Gt/CO2 whereas the scenarios imply this should be about 4-6 Gt lower.

## What role does redistribution or general distribution play in all this?
