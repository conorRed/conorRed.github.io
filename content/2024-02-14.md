Act -> Inspiration -> Motivation. It's actually a circle. I need to start taking actions for
motivation to come and to get that feedback. With work, I need to break down my tasks into smaller
chunks that I can do to see progress.

I need to write those posts I think I can write. I need to contemplate some questions on the energy
front (decision making under uncertainty?).

It's a bit de moralising that my struggles are just very simple mechanisms of dopamine, but I can't
take it personally, I need to fight against it. I can't be afraid of my thoughts, they don't control
me nor I them, I can choose my response even though its difficult.


I need to start hanging posters or quotes up or something.
There has to be a fearlessness to ground our subjectivety in the objective. This is what I like
about Metzinger and consciousness.

# The trouble with optionality

[[Kierkegaard]] may be referring to optionality and the addiction of it.

> The shortest distance between two points is reliably a straight line. If your dreams are apparent

> road to pursuing your dreamy outcomes. They are dangerous diversions that will change you.
