* Humes arguments of the problem with induction
* So I wasn't far off in treating functions as cause and effect relationships, or relations
    * From : [Russell's the Philosophical importance of Mathematical Logic](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/russell.htm)
    * "'When the same cause happens again, the same effect will also happen.' But it might be very justly remarked that
      the same cause never happens again. What actually takes place is that there is a constant relation between causes
      of a certain kind and the effects which result from them. Wherever there is such a constant relation, the effect
      is a function of the cause. By means of the constant relation we sum up in a single formula an infinity of causes
      and effects, and we avoid the worn-out hypothesis of the repetition of the same cause."
    * "It is the idea of functionality, that is to say the idea of constant relation, which gives the secret of the
      power of mathematics to deal simultaneously with an infinity of data."
    * I didn't really follow the talk on infinity in this one.
    * Russell talks about generalising statements like 'All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is
      mortal' to "If x is an a, then, if all the members of a are members of b, it follows that x is a b.":wq
    * Logical constant here are things that can not be replaced by variables that operate on some continuum that keep the
      relation
    * " If I say: "Here are two things, and here are two other things, therefore here arc four things in all", I do not
      state a proposition of pure mathematics because here particular data come into question. The proposition that I
      have stated is an application of the general proposition"
* Did caffeine manipulate us to create the world where it thrives? Evolutionarily
