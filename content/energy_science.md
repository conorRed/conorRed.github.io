* [Mineralogy](mineralogy) 
* Minerals or Energy utilisation
    * surface offers holes, that electrons can be attracted to.
    * Defects on the surface are good places for growing crystals (?)
    * How a crystal develops from a solution

* Nuclear Reactor Technology
    * "Introductory Nuclear Physics" S.Krane
    * Converting mass to energy, close to mega electron volts, much higher than common ionization energies.
    * 03/11/22 15:02:26 
        * Went through the basics of nuclear chemistry before this. So maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to follow along.
        * Bromine, decays to kryptonium which is a gas, all the way down to strontium, which isn't really radioactive.
        * If bromine is in excited state can also emit a neutron?
        * Fission product is never really in a ground state. 
        * Most of the reaction energy goes into kinetic energy of the fission fragments which is absorbed by the
          lattice (Uranium fuel).
        * Neutron flux? "Neutron flux is defined as the number of neutrons crossing unit area of the medium in unit
          time"
        * Trying to control and contain the neutrons to 'activate' further reactions.
        * A good reaction design, when the neutron life cycle is completely under our control.
    * 09/11/22 14:02:05 
        * Efficient moderator something with a low A number (Atomic mass?).
        * Increasing enrichment for fuel makes it safer?
    * 17/11/22 15:01:10 
        * Design safety factor, take worst case scenario and factor it by this.
        * Looking at pressure on the containing vessels as collisions per sec. 
        * Amount of pressure that can be reached from steam generation.
        * Xenon (fission product) has a massive cross section. 
* [Electrochemistry](Electrochemistry)
* Carbon capture and storage... I think

        * Here we go, trying to follow wtf Juan is saying
        * Sequestration, you put CO2 underground in a safe area. An in depth study is needed for the area it's to be
          put.
        * Avenues to put CO2 into more stable forms (so they don't release into the atmosphere).
            * Mineralisation: reaction with rocks that turns CO2 into a solid, can be stable for sometimes millions of
              years.
            * Minerals used in filters to take CO2 from air.
            * Bauxite destroys nature.
            * Jesus, pack it in Juan
    * 10/11/22 12:02:21 
        * EOR offsets the CO2 'sequestered' by the amount of oil you get.
        * 4 trillion dollars projected to be made through EOR.
        * Smaller ions have a higher density of charge.
        * Dolomite is produced at ambient temperatures (mountains) but for some reason it can't be reproduced at ambient
          temperatures in a lab.
        * Activity as the measure of availability of ions.
        * You know what, Juan isn't so bad. It's more of a me issue. He is trying to break things down for us.
        * Lot of good analogies from movies of crowds looking at you.
    * 17/11/22 12:15:37 
        * The partial pressure of CO2 changes the pH of the water or liquid below. CO2 mixes with water and produces
          carbonic acid.
        * Concentration of calcite will be higher at lower pH's.
        * Two types of carbonates is 6 fold or 9 fold with oxygen.
        * Something soluble is always more stable.
        * Modify the solubility product you can make something more stable. Free energy to cation radius graph.
        * VS: vigorous shaking.

## Gaps in Knowledge

* How electron configurations determine bonding
    * Why things stick together, why the universe isn't just one big bond?
