    * Monday, Wednesday, senior sophister room, from week 5-14 10am-5pm
    * Carnot cycle, working at two different temperatures, cold and hot sinks are added for the isothermal parts.
    * Temperature is changed in the adiabatic path
    * The temperature differential is a way to reset the process, to get work repeatedly.
    * $q_p = (U_f + PV_f) - (U_i + PV_i) = H_f - H_i$ we have an initial state ($(U_i + PV_i)$) and final state
      ($(U_f + PV_f)$), our knew measure then is a state function
    * Standard conditions operate as a calibration for measurements of Enthalpy

    * Entropy is NOT a measure of disorder
    * A measure of the dispersal of energy
    * When entropy is a max the system reaches equilibrium 
    * Entropy is the change in reversible heat $dq_{rev} = TdS$ and $dW = -PdV$
    * Look at it in terms of degree of freedom?
* 29/09/22 09:55:58 Lecture #6
    * Internal energy that is available for work(?)
    * How many different ways to distribute energy in particles
    * micro state? Atom with a set amount of quanta
    * If we look at the energy levels of the atoms. If you have a given amount of energy say 3 (units) and 4 atoms
      to distribute it between, you could have one atom at energy level 3 and the others at zero, permutations in
      the energy levels.
    * The higher the number of particles, more ways the energy could be distributed
    * Heat transfer to cold sink is always greater for irreversible process because less heat is used for work.
* 03/10/22 09:45:16 Lecture #7
    * 10 problems covering all material, due most likely before xmas
    * Derive maxwell relations
    * All Thermodynamic properties can be derived from Gibbs energy
    * allotrope, forms in which an element can exist
    * $(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial T})_v = -S_m$ Largest slope is for gases, degrees of freedom. Entropy linked to degrees of freedom.
    * Henry's law good for low mole fractions, Raoult's law good for high mole fractions as it works with ideal solutes

    * Slowest step normally dictates rate of reaction
    * a chemical equation doesn't convey much about the mechanism of a reaction
    * As more molecules are involved in an elementary reaction it becomes less likely (reducing entropy of all the
      molecules you've to gather)
    * Defn. of an elementary reaction is arbitrary? Or intuitive
    * SN2 reaction
