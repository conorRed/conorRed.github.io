[[Kierkegaard]]
### Why is there a sense of sadness, or the tragic to A's position on life?

A says that the mind is 'beyond either/or' but it seems somewhat that he lives in denial of the
reality of the world. In saying that, I feel drawn to his conclusion that what's beautiful is the
abstract.

He does not commit to anything as this ultimately binds oneself to the whole, the inability to have
further possibilities. The brook furiously trying to get to the ocean and be taken by it's currents
rather than observing that ocean.

- I need to start doing things for fun. I think writing on Irish history through the lens of land
  reform could be fun.
- I think I'd like to get started on building the probability library in Rust.
