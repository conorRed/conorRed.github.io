# In praise of idleness

> One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some government. In view of the
> fact that the bulk of the expenditure of most civilized governments consists in payments for past
> wars and preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a government is in the same
> position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the manâ€™s economical
> habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it
> would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it on drink or gambling


> what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earthâ€™s
> surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is
> unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of
> indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders but those who give advice as to
> what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two
> different bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not
> knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive
> speaking and writing, i.e. of advertising.

> Modern technic has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small
> privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work
> is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.

> To this day ninety-nine per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if it were
> proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working man. The conception of duty,
> speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for
> the interests of their masters rather than their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this
> fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger
> interests of humanity.
