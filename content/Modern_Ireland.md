# Modern Ireland


At the beginning  of the 1600's  there were three main interest groups in Ireland.
* Gaelic Irish: The patchwork of Ireland ruled by kings and chiefs as a descendant of the time before the arrival of the
  Normans
    * Steamrolled by Wentworth in that he tried to just take land in Wicklow to enlarge his personal fortune
* Old English: Those of English heritage that arrived in Ireland before the Tudor conquests
    * Aiming for the Graces
    * Is there a trend of wanting legislative independence?
* New English
    * Wentworth immediately started laying down the law on 'rags to riches' colonisers in Ireland (As Charles was
      suspicious of them)
* Ulster scots: Arrival with the plantation of Ulster
    * Wentworth wanted them to renounce Presbyterianism under the 'Black Oath' a lot fled to Scotland to join
      anti-laudism (catholic push under Charles)
* Wentworth can be seen as 'implementing' Laudianism in Ireland. Harassing non Catholics, recovering Church land
* After the Scots drew up a covenant against the 'popery' of Laud, Charles wanted to get parliement on his side so
  brought Wentworth back to London. There was then action remove Wentworth. He was seen as an evil counselor.
* The english groups in Ireland helped in this case.
* Foster emphasises the scottish irish interdependence of events as well as the more obvious england ireland
  interdependence

The Church of England was not a theological whole. Ideas really come into play here. What was the thinking behind
Laudianism, how was it to improve life for the English people, why did Charles like the idea?
* Example of religion having such an impact whether we like it or not, these ideas were extremely influential.

# Notes

* The source of action in late 16th century Ireland is as a result of the change to the Church of England.
* Why was there a rebellion in 1642?
* Confederate, an attempt to establish your own republic?
* What are the anti-catholic laws at different points in time, e.g. at the start of the 1600's
