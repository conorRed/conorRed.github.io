    - The dot product is the magnitude of one vector multiplied by the component of the other parrallel to the first. Scalar.
    - The cross product is the magnitude of one vector multiplied by the component of the other perpendicular to the first. Vector.
        - The perpendicular chosen depends on the rotation size to close the angle between the two vectors
    - Acceleration will always have some magnitude, unless a particle is moving in a straight line with constant speed.
