- Markets manage roughly 2/3 of US electricity generation
- Electricity demand is generally inelastic, such that demand is slow to change in the face of price
  change.
- Demand is elastic.
- Gas power plants need constant gas flow through pipelines which is bought on a market (responsive
  to demand).
- Coal would be bought at everyday prices ahead of time.
- Nuclear and geothermal also buys fuel ahead of time but has high up front capital costs.

A node is a point where electricity is either injected into the grid (generation) or withdrawn
from the grid (consumption).
