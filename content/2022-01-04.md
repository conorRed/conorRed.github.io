* > The history of the Internet is, in part, the history of the birth, adoption, and stewardship of distributed protocols
by the broader community.
* Ledger, coins/tokens are fundamental abstractions for crypto.
* The 'who' editing the ledger can be an account or a smart contract
* NFT's are a programmable token (?) they can offer different ways for uptake within the system?
* Immutable code can not be fixed. So what look likes a benefit for smart contracts might be a fault
* Seems keen on the design space of tokens. How the might mimic property rights, ownership etc.

* A lot of innovation needs to take place in this space. It's just a matter of whether it will or not.

* Blockchain as a state machine
* How do Web 3.0 apps look compared to Web 2.0 apps. It its not just creating this massive monolith (like a giant github
