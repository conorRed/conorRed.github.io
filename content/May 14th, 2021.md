    - [[Sam Altman]]
    - Might be worth exploring sam altmans interests in nuclear fusion
    - Very interesting views on the decline of Silicon valley and san Francisco, lack of social capital (common values, cultural context) and the poor effects of tech companies.
    - He also talks about the need for leaders to be making unpopular 'rational' choices how that can degrade the community over time.
    - He also answered an incredibly interesting question about the rise in simple narratives to explain the world to which he said that we have failed to create a vision of the future where everyone wins. Which i find very apt. he also relates this to his work with Open Ai in hopes that he can also help flip the narrative on AI.
        - Pessimism is always easier than optimism
    - 
- [[thoughts ü§î]] #career If I was to be anywhere or doing anything right now, what would it be, what would I be content with? Or should I create the world I want to live in?
    - Working on the next moon mission
    - Determining the make up of the cosmos
    - Contributing to nuclear fusion research and development
        - Working on fundamental energy breakthroughs
    - Developing AI ability or being involved in its development
        - Why is AI an inevitability [[?]]
    - Being around people that could maybe define a path and provide viewpoints on the world, who read more than me.
    - Being in a constant state of asking questions and having the freedom to go figure them out.
    - striving to give people meaning to the future [of humanity] to get a collaborative view of the future where we all win.
        - I want everyone to win, why dont others?
        - Also, how does scientific exploration help us achieve this?
- [[thoughts ü§î]] Is there a critical mass for a self sustaining economy, critical mass for products and services (whether external or internal to the location), if so, what is it? specifically with startups.
    - I think it would be interesting to analyse economic growth, to GROK it and see its implications
- [[physics]]
    - Learning about relative velocities this morning is sending me for a spin cycle, I guess its the way the world just is but thats hard to understand some times.
        - Thats kind of the beauty all the same
    - Along with the velocity of a stationary observer to a moving one relative to the earth. The observer its relative too is stationary though I suppose
- [[OPSENG-31655]] #work
    - Currently trying to grok how a service is upgraded in scylla, it seems to depend on whether its a workday stack component or a platform cluster with custom services.
    - We're mainly focused on the upgrading of components on the workday stack?
    - Where is the scylla cluster deployed to configured?
    - Does everything get deployed as a [[kubernetes]] [[service]] An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. ?
    - How do I find out the environment my scylla cluster is in?
- It looks like there could be a civil war in Israel based on the conflict in the Gaza strip between Arab and Jewish populations in Israel's cities. 
    - Its definitely on a knife's edge over there, its nuts.
    - wtf are we doing
- [[Ethiopia]]
    - " Simon Marks, an Irish reporter for The Times who is based in Ethiopia"
    - Abiy ahmed revoked journalists credentials and blocking coverage. Does he really believe this is the right way or is he just an evil person?
- #housing https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/reits-are-not-the-enemy-and-emotion-is-not-a-policy-1.4563313
    - "willing to provide billions of euro of investment that will help build homes in Ireland; or they can frighten away international property capital by imposing taxes that would allow a Minister to issue a press release saying they had ‚Äústuck it to the Reits‚Äù.
    - There are 62,000 households on the housing waiting list which in a rough calculation it would cost ‚Ç¨20 billion to build homes for. As it stands the vast majority of that is expected to come from international institutional investors.
    - If we want to turn off that tap then of course as a sovereign democratic Republic we can do so. But if that is our choice ‚Äì and it seems to be implied by the housing policy of at least one major party in Opposition ‚Äì then we better be ready for the implications of adding ‚Ç¨20 billion to our national debt and the need to service that debt when interest rates rise, perhaps sooner rather than later if bond markets are spooked by our spending.
- Russians might clone scythians
- Eigenbros anyone can be a physicist [[physics]]
