[[Bayesian Data Analysis]]
- I like his example of Hubbles constant as the parameter.
- If two scientists were to compare what they got for it from similar data, how would we evaluate
the over theory etc.
- Latent variables: unobserved and unknown
- Connecting the latent variable to the data is through the _likelihood_(?)
