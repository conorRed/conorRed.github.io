## Notes

* [Asimov on why space flight]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Ux83nJC0U)
    * I like Asimov's argument here as to why we should focus on space flight and leaving the planet. Aiming for these
      things helps give a holistic view of our planet, encourages us to strive together for something bigger than our
      invented borders
* [Absence of evidence is evidence of Absence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/mnS2WYLCGJP2kQkRn)
    * "Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality; if you are equally
      good at explaining any outcome you have zero knowledge."
* [Expected Evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/jiBFC7DcCrZjGmZnJ)
    * "the mere expectation of encountering evidence—before you’ve actually seen it—should not shift your prior beliefs."
    * "a true Bayesian, it is impossible to seek evidence that confirms a theory...You can only ever seek evidence to test a theory, not to confirm it."
* [Hindsight Bias](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/WnheMGAka4fL99eae)
    * Trying to figure out what is really something we couldn't have determined with our current models. With hindsight bias
      all results seem obvious
    * Putting ourselves in the situation where we feel our models of the world could not determine the answer. And then
      seeing how our models stack up to the result.
    * What kind of evidence to we currently have for predicting the likelihood of some proposition
    * "In hindsight bias, people who know the outcome of a situation believe the outcome should have been easy to
      predict in advance. "
