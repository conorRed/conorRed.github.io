I should try and develop an agent that could do my React work. The context could contain things like Norman's book.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWh2_OlFvSw this might be a start.

I think I need to try and understand what makes the transformer architecture special.

- Population growth was a consistent pressure/goal.
- Humans intentionally modified practices to raise yields.
- Nutritional needs could not be met without grains dominating.
- Laboring tasks were the main bottlenecks, not land availability.
- Central authority was most effective at mobilizing resources.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
