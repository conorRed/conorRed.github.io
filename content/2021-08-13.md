## Notes

* [Grant sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_6AYX42gkU)
    * Exponential growth happens when the thing thats growing spurs its own growth. For instance, the internet increases
      connectivity and learning which in turns increasing the connectivity and learning of the internet
    * Rate of progress is proportional to the amount you have
* [Oxford debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBQBqDVsnuI)
    * "As a society we are rooted much more in humanism, than religion"
    * We continue to draw on the substance of the Christian heritage. Of the Christian ideal of justice and love (free
      speech, etc.)

    * Empiricism vs rationalism, Using experiment or experience to prove or disprove an idea. Reason is irrelevant, its
      what is. Points to reading Shakespeare as opposed to some political philosophy about how people may act or ought
      to act.
    * The standard model (science) has a narrative structure. Its an attempt to explain, to put in a box. The idea of
      science.
