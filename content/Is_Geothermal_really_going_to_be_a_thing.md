* Need high heat differentials to compete with natural gas and make electricity generation more efficient
* temp increases by 25C with every km of depth
* Drilling costs are exponential with depth

* Enhanced geothermal creates reservoirs and attempts to connect the wells. Cold water is passed down one well to be
  heated and let out the other wells.
* This requires conductive properties of the rock between wells
* EGS requires a level of control in fracturing that oil and gas development does not need.
