    - Tough one this morning, really struggling with intuiting relative velocities.
    - Also, got stuck on a uniform distributions problem.
    - 21:46 For relative velocity. When taking yourself as a frame of reference, you dont see
      yourself moving, you see the world around you moving.
        - Have to internalise the idea that an object that is (objectively) moving in a straight
          line can be move diagonally from the frame of reference of a moving observer.

    - Excellent podcast
    - Can we accept the conflict as the truth, that aspiration for knowledge. If we had knowledge
      there would be no conflict but we don't have knowledge therefore there is conflict.
        - "I think the way I am is that I see a bunch of conflicts, and I don’t know how to resolve
          them. And that’s just my ignorance. If I had knowledge, I would know how to resolve them.
          But what I at least try to do is to not be under the illusion that I have the knowledge
          already."
    - Podcast also talks about incentives and how the aim of meritocracy is to provide a way to
      grow, competition for growth. The problems arise when you use it as a vehicle for non
      productive emotions. She says, to leverage out of the impoverished point of view on value.
    - She argues that maybe the Hobbesian view isn't necessarily correct, maybe civil society is a
      way to limit our altruism, to limit our attention to the suffering of others. Which raises the
      idea that if survival of the individual in society becomes more secure, can we transition back
      into that 'inherent' state of altruism?

    - "School is a closed-world domain—you are solving crisply-defined puzzles...your solution is
      evaluated on one dimension (letter grade), and the performance ceiling (an A+) is low"
    - "The real world is the polar opposite. You’ll have some ultra-vague end goal ...  solution’s
      performance has many different dimensions (speed, reliability, usability, repeatability, cost,
      …)—you probably don’t even know what all the dimensions are, let alone which are the most
      important. ... "
    - You can apply the excess 'hard thinking' or brain power you might have thought needed to be
      used up on solving the right problems, working more quickly or automating a solution.
