### System: Frames

The more frames the better.

* Elbow frame, use forearm to _push_ away persons hips.
* Forearm on neck with flaring up to ceiling.

### System: goal

#### Hips away from hips

- Elbow frame means they can't stay tight to your hips so you're near leg can fill that space.
- If they're tight to your hips, use underarm push to move their head inline with yours, then hip escape.
- Near leg should be extending or 'kicking'.
- Don't bring in knee before creating distance.

#### Pummel forearm under neck

With this space your can get the forearm frame on the neck as the space to pummel is created.

## Guard Passing

* Try and face their back to you.
* Look for staging positions (where you're stable).


## De La Riva

### Frames

- Control the near heal (do not let knee turn out).
