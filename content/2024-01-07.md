I was thinking a bit last night about how to manage goals this year. It's unrealistic to even get
40hrs of work done in an area in a month. Time moves quickly though and a sense of urgency is
important for making some sort of progress.

I think it's important to break down goals into weekly or daily chunks.

On the [[career]] front, there are some themes I'm thinking about:

* Building Resilient systems:
    * Static typing.
    * Distributed systems principles like self-healing etc.
