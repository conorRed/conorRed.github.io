- [Paper on expected productivity vs actual](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16574.pdf)
    - "Overall, we complete 53% of our weekly tasks in the originally planned week. The
actual number of hours required to complete a task is, on average, 1.7x as many hours
as expected (with a median multiplier of 1.4x)"
    - coding seems to take about 3-7 times as long as expected
- Learning about Bayes theorem... again
    - I like the taking a sample size n. Using a known quantity who might have X .

    - Prior odds x Relative likelihoods = Posterior odds
        - odds form of Bayes' rule
        - You use relative likelihoods as the prior odds is the same despite the magnitude of each.
        - So the relative likelihood doesnt care about percentages because what we are looking for is the end proportion.
        - hmm "In general, the strength of evidence is summarized by how __relatively__ likely different states of the world make our observations."
        - What proportion of our final pool came from one of the two streams.
        - To convert proportion to probability divide portion by sum of portions.
        - Conditional probability restricts our worlds the where Y is the case. Looking only at cases where Y is true
- Cliff Chang on Ezra Klein talks about magic (in fantasy) used as a metaphor for feeling unique or special.
- Need to look at deploy locations
