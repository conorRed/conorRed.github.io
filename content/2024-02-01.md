From internal


Rising financing costs, tighter public budgets, and the realisation of the complexity of some of the
concrete steps required to get serious about climate action will cause a backlash against the energy
transition in Europe. While the buildout of renewables is likely to continue, and we are likely to
see another record of GWs added this year, we are likely to see little progress in decarbonising
industry, households, and agriculture.

Prediction

We are unlikely to see net zero targets officially being abandoned or pushed back, but we will be
further away from getting onto a trajectory towards meeting them than at the end of 2023. The
elections for the European Parliament in May will bring a substantially more conservative
parliament, and also, the next European Commission is likely to be less progressive than the current
one in climate terms. Germany is likely to become a weaker proponent of ambitious climate action in
the European Council, with either a deadlocked continuation of the current governing coalition or a
less progressive coalition government in its stead. Policies particularly likely to be called into
doubt and/or pushed back are the phaseout of gas in heating, deep decarbonisation of industry, and,
linked to that, the amount of new EUAs being issued in the ETS falling to 0 towards 2040 under the
current linear reduction factor

This seems quite cynical.
