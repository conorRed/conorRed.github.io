# A Demon Haunted World

There's a scene I was watching where the two protagonists go to a gun conference or whatever you might call that. I
wondered "How can people convince themselves that something like this is a good, that they're on the right track" Then
Sagan's words from this book ring truer than ever. People can believe lost of funny things. This book really does deal
with ideas of 'irrationality'. You could say its remnants of a pre industrial past but it really revolves around
science and the process of the enlightenment that is still on going. How do we navigate our world as it really is,
without the crutches that we use. How do we do that properly.
