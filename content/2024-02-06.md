Read an article on whether Ireland's arts culture is strong. Do we have a strong library system?

Ireland's cultural popularity is unique. Imagine if the same output was from a state like Wisconsin

- Maybe that's what I'm unhappy about.


Feedback so far (just cos it's sooo much easier write here.)

#career

- Develop ability with algorithms. This could be hosting lightning talks on a book I read/exercises
I do. Proposed book would be SICP.
- What can I do where I feel growth?
- What can I do to express my creativity?

I'd like to convey feedback relating to my experience too. coming from a big company and managing
expectations etc.
