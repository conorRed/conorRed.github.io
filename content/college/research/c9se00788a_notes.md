# Section 2

The defined system boundaries are important, in the case of WtP where the combustion process is not included it removes
the need to analysis the efficiency of the engine used and the miles travelled. This is the problem with functional
units and why physical quantities are often not enough as a functional unit.

This could be, for allocation, have a certain set of properties of fuel to be pumped into the engine. For the
consequential it might be more like, do the above with a given cost to the consumer or without affecting land in some
geographical region. You're fuel amount might be influenced by these constraints, in the allocation version the fuel
amount or output is fixed.

## Main types of Allocation methods

* Energy allocation: allocating results of a pathway by the energy content of the feedstock.
* Mass allocation: allocate emissions based on k
