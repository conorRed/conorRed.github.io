	abstract = {Life-cycle assessment ({LCA}) practitioners build models to quantify resource consumption, environmental releases, and potential environmental and human health impacts of product systems. Most often, practitioners deﬁne a model structure, assign a single value to each parameter, and build deterministic models to approximate environmental outcomes. This approach fails to capture the variability and uncertainty inherent in {LCA}. To make good decisions, decision makers need to understand the uncertainty in and divergence between {LCA} outcomes for different product systems. Several approaches for conducting {LCA} under uncertainty have been proposed and implemented. For example, Monte Carlo simulation and fuzzy set theory have been applied in a limited number of {LCA} studies. These approaches are well understood and are generally accepted in quantitative decision analysis. But they do not guarantee reliable outcomes. A survey of approaches used to incorporate quantitative uncertainty analysis into {LCA} is presented. The suitability of each approach for providing reliable outcomes and enabling better decisions is discussed. Approaches that may lead to overconﬁdent or unreliable results are discussed and guidance for improving uncertainty analysis in {LCA} is provided.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment ({LCA}) calculates the environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle. Uncertainty analysis is an important aspect in {LCA}, and is usually performed using Monte Carlo sampling. In this study, Monte Carlo sampling, Latin hypercube sampling, quasi Monte Carlo sampling, analytical uncertainty propagation and fuzzy interval arithmetic were compared based on e.g. convergence rate and output statistics. Each method was tested on three {LCA} case studies, which differed in size and behaviour. Uncertainty propagation in {LCA} using a sampling method leads to more (directly) usable information compared to fuzzy interval arithmetic or analytical uncertainty propagation. Latin hypercube and quasi Monte Carlo sampling provide more accuracy in determining the sample mean than Monte Carlo sampling and can even converge faster than Monte Carlo sampling for some of the case studies discussed in this paper.},

To achieve this, efﬁcient decision support integrates the results of pre-existing models. Many environmental models are deterministic, but the uncertainty of their outcomes needs to be estimated when they are utilized for decision support. We review various methods that have been or could be applied to evaluate the uncertainty related to deterministic models' outputs. We cover expert judgement, model emulation, sensitivity analysis, temporal and spatial variability in the model outputs, the use of multiple models, and statistical approaches, and evaluate when these methods are appropriate and what must be taken into account when utilizing them. The best way to evaluate the uncertainty depends on the deﬁnitions of the source models and the amount and quality of information available to the modeller.},

	abstract = {In the support of environmental management, models are frequently used. The outcomes of these models however, rarely show a perfect resemblance to the real-world system behavior. This is due to uncertainties, introduced during the process of abstracting information about the system to include it in the model. To provide decision makers with realistic information about these model outcomes, uncertainty analysis is indispensable. Because of the multiplicity of frameworks available for uncertainty analysis, the outcomes of such analyses are rarely comparable. In this paper a method for structured identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of uncertainties in the application of environmental models is presented. We adapted an existing uncertainty framework to enhance the objectivity in the uncertainty identiﬁcation process. Two case studies demonstrate how it can help to obtain an overview of unique uncertainties encountered in a model. The presented method improves the comparability of uncertainty analyses in different model studies and leads to a coherent overview of uncertainties affecting model outcomes.},

	abstract = {Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) is intended as a quantitative decision support tool. However, the large amount of uncertainty characteristic of LCA studies reduces confidence in results. To date, little research has been reported regarding the comparative sources of uncertainty (and their relative importance) and how, or how commonly, they are quantified in attributional and consequential LCA. This paper answers these questions based on a review of recent LCA studies and methods papers, and advances recommendations for improved practice.
Methods All relevant LCA methods papers as well as case studies (amounting to 2687 journal articles) published from 2014 to 2018 in the top seven journals publishing LCA studies were reviewed. Common sources and methods for analysis of uncertainty in both attributional and consequential LCA were described, and their frequency of application evaluated. Observed practices were compared to best practice recommendations from methods papers, and additional recommendations were advanced.
Results and discussion Less than 20\% of LCA studies published in the past five years reported any kind of uncertainty analysis. There are many different sources of uncertainty in LCA, which can be classified as parameter, scenario or model uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty is most often reported, although the other types are considered equally important. There are also sources of uncertainty specific to each kind of LCA—in particular related to the resolution of multi-functionality problems (i.e. allocation in attributional LCA versus the definition of market-mediated substitution scenarios in consequential LCA). However, there are currently no widely applied methods to specifically account for these sources of uncertainty other than sensitivity analysis. Monte Carlo sampling was the most popular method used for propagating uncertainty results, regardless of LCA type.
Conclusions Data quality scores and inherent (i.e. stochastic) uncertainty data are widely available in LCI databases, and researchers should generally be able to define comparable uncertainty information for their primary data. Moreover, uncertainty propagation for parameter uncertainty is supported by LCA modelling software. There are hence no obvious barriers to quantifying parameter uncertainty in LCA studies. More standardized methods based upon context-specific data that strike the right balance between comprehensiveness and usability are, however, necessary in order to better account for both the shared and unique sources of uncertainty in attributional and consequential LCAs. More frequent and comprehensive reporting of uncertainty analysis is strongly recommended for published LCA studies. Improved practices should be encouraged and supported by peer-reviewers, editors, LCI databases and LCA software developers.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual basis for the systematic treatment of uncertainty in model-based decision support activities such as policy analysis, integrated assessment and risk assessment. It focuses on the uncertainty perceived from the point of view of those providing information to support policy decisions (i.e., the modellers’ view on uncertainty) – uncertainty regarding the analytical outcomes and conclusions of the decision support exercise. Within the regulatory and management sciences, there is neither commonly shared terminology nor full agreement on a typology of uncertainties. Our aim is to synthesise a wide variety of contributions on uncertainty in model-based decision support in order to provide an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for systematic uncertainty analysis. To that end we adopt a general deﬁnition of uncertainty as being any deviation from the unachievable ideal of completely deterministic knowledge of the relevant system. We further propose to discriminate among three dimensions of uncertainty: location, level and nature of uncertainty, and we harmonise existing typologies to further detail the concepts behind these three dimensions of uncertainty. We propose an uncertainty matrix as a heuristic tool to classify and report the various dimensions of uncertainty, thereby providing a conceptual framework for better communication among analysts as well as between them and policymakers and stakeholders. Understanding the various dimensions of uncertainty helps in identifying, articulating, and prioritising critical uncertainties, which is a crucial step to more adequate acknowledgement and treatment of uncertainty in decision support endeavours and more focused research on complex, inherently uncertain, policy issues.},
