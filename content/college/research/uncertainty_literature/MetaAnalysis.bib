	abstract = {Life-cycle assessment ({LCA}) practitioners build models to quantify resource consumption, environmental releases, and potential environmental and human health impacts of product systems. Most often, practitioners deﬁne a model structure, assign a single value to each parameter, and build deterministic models to approximate environmental outcomes. This approach fails to capture the variability and uncertainty inherent in {LCA}. To make good decisions, decision makers need to understand the uncertainty in and divergence between {LCA} outcomes for different product systems. Several approaches for conducting {LCA} under uncertainty have been proposed and implemented. For example, Monte Carlo simulation and fuzzy set theory have been applied in a limited number of {LCA} studies. These approaches are well understood and are generally accepted in quantitative decision analysis. But they do not guarantee reliable outcomes. A survey of approaches used to incorporate quantitative uncertainty analysis into {LCA} is presented. The suitability of each approach for providing reliable outcomes and enabling better decisions is discussed. Approaches that may lead to overconﬁdent or unreliable results are discussed and guidance for improving uncertainty analysis in {LCA} is provided.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment ({LCA}) calculates the environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle. Uncertainty analysis is an important aspect in {LCA}, and is usually performed using Monte Carlo sampling. In this study, Monte Carlo sampling, Latin hypercube sampling, quasi Monte Carlo sampling, analytical uncertainty propagation and fuzzy interval arithmetic were compared based on e.g. convergence rate and output statistics. Each method was tested on three {LCA} case studies, which differed in size and behaviour. Uncertainty propagation in {LCA} using a sampling method leads to more (directly) usable information compared to fuzzy interval arithmetic or analytical uncertainty propagation. Latin hypercube and quasi Monte Carlo sampling provide more accuracy in determining the sample mean than Monte Carlo sampling and can even converge faster than Monte Carlo sampling for some of the case studies discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Purpose Life cycle assessment ({LCA}) is intended as a quantitative decision support tool. However, the large amount of uncertainty characteristic of {LCA} studies reduces confidence in results. To date, little research has been reported regarding the comparative sources of uncertainty (and their relative importance) and how, or how commonly, they are quantified in attributional and consequential {LCA}. This paper answers these questions based on a review of recent {LCA} studies and methods papers, and advances recommendations for improved practice.
Methods All relevant {LCA} methods papers as well as case studies (amounting to 2687 journal articles) published from 2014 to 2018 in the top seven journals publishing {LCA} studies were reviewed. Common sources and methods for analysis of uncertainty in both attributional and consequential {LCA} were described, and their frequency of application evaluated. Observed practices were compared to best practice recommendations from methods papers, and additional recommendations were advanced.
Results and discussion Less than 20\% of {LCA} studies published in the past five years reported any kind of uncertainty analysis. There are many different sources of uncertainty in {LCA}, which can be classified as parameter, scenario or model uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty is most often reported, although the other types are considered equally important. There are also sources of uncertainty specific to each kind of {LCA}—in particular related to the resolution of multi-functionality problems (i.e. allocation in attributional {LCA} versus the definition of market-mediated substitution scenarios in consequential {LCA}). However, there are currently no widely applied methods to specifically account for these sources of uncertainty other than sensitivity analysis. Monte Carlo sampling was the most popular method used for propagating uncertainty results, regardless of {LCA} type.
Conclusions Data quality scores and inherent (i.e. stochastic) uncertainty data are widely available in {LCI} databases, and researchers should generally be able to define comparable uncertainty information for their primary data. Moreover, uncertainty propagation for parameter uncertainty is supported by {LCA} modelling software. There are hence no obvious barriers to quantifying parameter uncertainty in {LCA} studies. More standardized methods based upon context-specific data that strike the right balance between comprehensiveness and usability are, however, necessary in order to better account for both the shared and unique sources of uncertainty in attributional and consequential {LCAs}. More frequent and comprehensive reporting of uncertainty analysis is strongly recommended for published {LCA} studies. Improved practices should be encouraged and supported by peer-reviewers, editors, {LCI} databases and {LCA} software developers.},

	abstract = {Purpose The use of life cycle assessment ({LCA}) as a decision support tool can be hampered by the numerous uncertainties embedded in the calculation. The treatment of uncertainty is necessary to increase the reliability and credibility of {LCA} results. The objective is to provide an overview of the methods to identify, characterize, propagate (uncertainty analysis), understand the effects (sensitivity analysis), and communicate uncertainty in order to propose recommendations to a broad public of {LCA} practitioners.
Methods This work was carried out via a literature review and an analysis of {LCA} tool functionalities. In order to facilitate the identification of uncertainty, its location within an {LCA} model was distinguished between quantity (any numerical data), model structure (relationships structure), and context (criteria chosen within the goal and scope of the study). The methods for uncertainty characterization, uncertainty analysis, and sensitivity analysis were classified according to the information provided, their implementation in {LCA} software, the time and effort required to apply them, and their reliability and validity. This review led to the definition of recommendations on three levels: basic (low efforts with {LCA} software), intermediate (significant efforts with {LCA} software), and advanced (significant efforts with non-{LCA} software).
Results and discussion For the basic recommendations, minimum and maximum values (quantity uncertainty) and alternative scenarios (model structure/context uncertainty) are defined for critical elements in order to estimate the range of results. Result sensitivity is analyzed via one-at-a-time variations (with realistic ranges of quantities) and scenario analyses. Uncertainty should be discussed at least qualitatively in a dedicated paragraph. For the intermediate level, the characterization can be refined with probability distributions and an expert review for scenario definition. Uncertainty analysis can then be performed with the Monte Carlo method for the different scenarios. Quantitative information should appear in inventory tables and result figures. Finally, advanced practitioners can screen uncertainty sources more exhaustively, include correlations, estimate model error with validation data, and perform Latin hypercube sampling and global sensitivity analysis.
Conclusions Through this pedagogic review of the methods and practical recommendations, the authors aim to increase the knowledge of {LCA} practitioners related to uncertainty and facilitate the application of treatment techniques. To continue in this direction, further research questions should be investigated (e.g., on the implementation of fuzzy logic and model uncertainty characterization) and the developers of databases, {LCIA} methods, and software tools should invest efforts in better implementing and treating uncertainty in {LCA}.},
