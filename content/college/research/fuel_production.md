Liam has modelled this with a 'mass balance'. An initial quantity of cooking oil is 'mutated' through a set of processes
to produce a mass configuration that comprises: jet fuel, propane, naphtha and others.

> The products of the whole fuel production process are propane, naphtha, hydro processed jet fuel, bio diesel, some
residual oils and water.

Hydrocarbons are identified throughout the process by their boiling point and/or HC number.

> Vegetable oils contain 6 oxygen atoms per mole, which leads to oxygen contents of about 10 to 12 wt%. According to the
> nature of the starting vegetable oils, fatty acid hydrocarbon chains can exhibit various carbon atom distributions,
> which are generally in the range C8 to C24

After initial hydrotreatment, you're left with a diesel (C16 - C18), long alkane chains with a boiling point of about
280C. This product needs to be isomerized because that exhibits better cold flow properties (?). This process decreases
the cetane number though.

> lower cetane number have longer ignition delays, requiring more time for the fuel combustion process to be completed.

## Mass Balance

* Start with some composition of fatty acids. We break down triglyceride's into its consistuent parts but dont really do
  the same for di's and mono's.
* Left with FFA's and some of the acids (stearic etc.) that made up tri's.
* Another process (De carbonisation, oxygenation etc.) turn these into paraffins of different lengths.

Hydrogenation is process between an organic compound and hydrogen with a catalyst. The goal of it is normally to
saturate a compound (break double bonds).

In Liam's model we start with , they are considered all to become FFA's after the first stage. You're
then just left with FFA
