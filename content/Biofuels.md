# Biofuels, biomass and Hydrogen CH7003

* Absorption can be dependent on dipole moment (distribution of charge in bond). N2 has no dipole moment (same
  electronegativity).
* Fairly vague description as to why this is.

* Biomass is organic matter of non-fossil origin. More recent timescales of matter.
* Consider renewable, but not necessarily green, CO2 removed from environment quickly.
* Different connection and packing of monomers give different properties of wood.
* Cellulose around 75% of wood. The remainder is lignin. Heavily aromatic. More stable, doesn't rot as much as the
  polysaccharides do.
* Lignin will eventually form fossil fuels.
* Wood can be suitable for stationary applications, but it doesn't have a high energy density for something like cars.
* 1st generation is there because it requires the least amount of processing. As in, we're fairly sure how that works.
  They're easy to make. But also, we need them to sustain ourselves.
* God, his style of teaching is annoying. Like you're not asking a direct question.
* 2nd generation derived from non edible biomass: wood, oils. Feedstock that is not suitable for human consumption.

* 1st gen, biofuels requires fertiliser (growing of crop). Can also have N2O.
* Corn is most widely used crop for biofuels in the US.
* "assuming no land use change" is assuming that you just transition to growing them for biofuels, not carving out new
  land.
* Brazil, largely into biofuels still, due to residual from 1970's oil crisis.
* Major con for vegetable oil is just how tf do you collect it all. Like some infrastructure for disposal and
  collection.
* Can possibly get petrol compounds from algae. Can be genetically engineered.
* Trying to also make biofuels compatible with existing infrastructure, to reduce inertia of uptake.
* Distillation of crude oil, separating things by boiling point which depends largely on molecular mass.
* Can get different structures, the longer the carbon chain. Ethanol vs Butanol.
* Butanol is closer to petrol than ethanol. Because it's a longer carbon chain so it'll behave more like a pure
  hydrocarbon.
* Ethanol is easier to make.
* Energy density plays a role in how many times you would need to fill up your tank for instance.
* Triglycerides can be very heavy, possible difficulties in regular engines.
* Not too sure why we're looking at triglycerides.
