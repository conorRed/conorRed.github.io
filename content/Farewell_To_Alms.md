# Farewell To Alms

_Gregory Clarke_

> The New World after the Neolithic Revolution offered economic success to a different kind of agent than had been
typical in hunter-gatherer society: Those with patience, who could wait to enjoy greater consumption in the future. Thos
who liked to work long hours. And those who could perform formal calculations in a world of many types of inputs and
outputs...Thus it is plausible that through the long agrarian passage leading up to the Industrial Revolution man was
becoming _biologically_ better adapted to the modern economic world.
