They try and promote autonomy. So theres some niche problem, their employees should go tackle it,
get in the weeds. 'Mundane' things like sales tax or something.

[^1]: Thiel/Godin on the smallest viable audience.

They don't look for billion dollar markets, you look for 0 billion dollar markets. You try to create
your own markets [^1]. They say that A lot of business, looking for the profit pools, inadvertently
bet on economic stasis.

\marginnote{Theres a tension here. That where friction exists, you want to tackle it but also has
this lack of real feedback. Seth Godin moves in this different direction with friction. That it's
required to get going (He uses the analogy of skating or rowing) and then once moving can be smooth.
The problem I find is that sometimes we only check where we're going or what the problem is when we
hit the first friction point. }

Given the choice between the interesting and the comprehensible choice, the comprehensible will
survive in the zeitgeist. Reality does not have this interestingness bias. the mechanics of taxes,
remittance etc. they're not interesting but they're not an less _true_.

For Stripe's there's so many areas where gainful activity is just not taking place due to this
friction. Stripe believe that the sum of these things add up to a lot.
