      counts as electricity and oil
    * Could I look at the effects of R and D on innovation? 
    * Energy flows, energy needs to be moved between countries
    * US pushed to sell LNG to the EU, to be a more reliable source of energy. The over reliance on gas from Russia was
      evident (?)
    * Ask about IEA
    * moles of coal have huge molecular weight, compared to something like methane (natural gas)
