The 'love of wisdom' manifests itself as question and examining people for definitions of beliefs that they hold.

> A 'love of wisdom' is someone who arranges his life around an uncommon intellectual pursuit" p. 55 Blackson.

This describes Socrates and his particular intellectual pursuit.

The almost brash naivete on the part of Socrates is also seen at the start of Euthypro.
