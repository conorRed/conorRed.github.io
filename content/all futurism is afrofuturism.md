[[Noah Smith]]
Africa will be huge by the end of this century. The world population will grow by 1.9 billion people
and most of that will be Africa. Especially, demographically, the ages of 18-25 will be concentrated
in Africa.

38% of the population is expected to be from Africa in 2100. (Based on a medium fertility scenario).

The fertility rate transition and something Smith refers to as demographic dividend will increase
where those dependent on output (like children and older people) declines.
